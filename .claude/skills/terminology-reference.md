## Decoration Types

### Page-level elements

- **serlevha** / ʿunwān — illuminated headpiece at top of text opening
- **zahriye** — frontispiece, typically a full-page illuminated opening
- **cedvel** / jadwal — ruling and frame lines around text block
- **hâşiye** — marginal decoration
- **levha** — text panel
- **tığ** — finials / spike-like extensions from headpiece or medallion into margin
- **koltuk** — corner pieces / triangular margin fill between rectangular text block and arched frame
- **gül** — rosette (also used for verse markers in Qurans)

### Border system (pervaz / kenar suyu)

The Ottoman framing system uses layered borders around the text block:

- **iç pervaz** / **ara suyu** — inner border band (between text block cedvel and outer frame)
- **dış pervaz** / **kenar suyu** — outer border band (outermost frame around margins)
- **pervaz** — border (general); **dış pervazı** — outer border (for mounted calligraphy/painting)

### Marginal pictorial decoration

- **teşʿîr / tashʿīr** (تشعیر) — fine-line gold drawings in margins: animals, birds, plants, landscapes. Extremely delicate "hairline" work, typically gold on paper. Especially found in Persianate albums and luxury manuscripts. May be described in Turkish catalogues as "altın mürekkeple resim" or implied by "hayvan/şükûfe resimleri."

### Marginalia terms (search handles for margin-heavy manuscripts)

- **derkenar** (Ott., from Pers. dar-kanār) — marginal writing / note in the margin
- **hāmiš** (هامش, Ar.) — margin (physical space); also used for marginal glosses
- **kenar notu** (Ott.) — marginal note
- These are not decoration per se, but records noting "derkenar vardır" often indicate manuscripts with elaborate ruling/framing systems

### Binding decoration elements

- **şemse** / shamsa / toranj — central medallion (on bindings or pages)
- **salbek** / sar-toranj — pendant / tongue extending from şemse
- **köşebend** — corner pieces (on bindings)
- **zencirek / zencerek** (زنجيرك) — chain border: repeating interlinked ring/loop motifs in a narrow band. Applied to page edges, calligraphy panels, and binding edges.

### Motif families

- **rūmī** — split-leaf palmettes (characteristic of Seljuk/Ottoman tradition)
- **hatāyī** — Chinese-derived lotus and peony forms
- **bulut** / cloud band — Chinese-derived cloud scrolls. Subtypes: **yığma bulut** (heaped cloud), **dolantı bulut** (winding cloud), **ayırma bulut** (separating cloud), **Çin bulutu** (Chinese cloud)

- **gel-git / taraklı ebru** — combed marbling: parallel wavy lines from combing through the marbling size
- **vikaye yaprağı hatip ebrulu** — protective/guard flyleaf in hatip-marbled paper (flyleaf = vikaye yaprağı; confirms marbled paper at opening)
- **yan kağıtları ebrulu** — marbled side/margin papers (distinct from text block; found at both ends of volume — check opening AND closing pages when searching)
- **X.varak ebrulu kağıt üzeri yazılı** — folio X written on marbled paper (indicates scattered marbled leaves within a manuscript; targeted page navigation required)
- **vassale yöntemiyle ebrulu kağıda monte edilmiştir** — text panel window-mounted onto marbled paper via vassale technique (text block is separate from the decorated paper ground; see also *vassale* in Mounting section)
- **[Master name]'nin ebrusu tarzında** — attributed hatip ebru in the manner of a named master (e.g. "Hatip Mehmet Efendi'nin neftli sarı örneği tarzındaki enfes ebrusu"); signals a named workshop or attribution claim
- **ebrulu mukavva** — marbled board/cover (⚠ NOT paper decoration — binding only)
- **ebrulu cilt** — marbled binding (⚠ NOT paper decoration)
- **kapaklar hatip ebrulu / kapak içleri ebrulu / kutusu ebrulu** — hatip-marbled binding covers / doublures / slipcase (⚠ FP patterns in kagit_ozellikleri — cataloguer error placing binding description in paper field)

### Colored papers

- **mülevven** — colored paper. Simple standalone forms `Mülevven kağıt` (and `Abadî ve suyolu filigranli mülevven` — abadi paper with chain-line watermarks, colored) also used in kagit_ozellikleri
- **mülevven cedid** — new colored paper
- **boyalı** — dyed / painted paper

- **lacivert** — lapis blue (paper color)

### Stenciled, silhouetted, and impressed papers

No standardized Turkish cataloguing term exists for any of these techniques. Discovery in YEK requires descriptive keyword probes or image-based triage.

**Three distinct techniques:**

- **stenciled paper** — pigment applied through pre-cut stencil templates (masks) onto the paper surface. Produces flat-color motifs with crisp edges. Diagnostic traces: stencil bridges (tiny unpainted connectors inside closed shapes), misregistration between color layers, edge haloing/overspray, pigment pooling at mask edges
- **silhouetted paper** — pattern impressed between sheets with a pigmented sheet in the middle; the pressure transfers both the pattern relief and the color, creating a distinctly shadowed appearance. The middle (pigmented) sheet acts as the color source. Distinguished from stenciling by the pressure-transfer process and characteristic soft-edged shadow effect rather than crisp mask edges
- **impressed / relief paper** — pattern created by pressing between engraved matrices WITHOUT pigment; produces shadow/relief effect through paper deformation alone. Similar to silhouetted paper but lacks the color transfer from a pigmented intermediate sheet

**Related technique (distinct category):**

- **block-printed paper** — separate technique using carved wooden blocks pressed onto paper; may show press indentation and ink transfer. Distinct from stenciling (no mask involved) and from silhouetting (the block carries the pigment directly, not an intermediate sheet)

**⚠ Pouncing vs. stenciling:** Pouncing (perforated cartoon + powder transfer) is a *layout* technique, not finished decoration — gets conflated with stenciling in some catalogues. Pounce marks are preparatory (under paint/gilding), not the final decorative surface.

**Stenciled paper subtypes by material:**

- **stencil-applied color** — pigment brushed/dabbed through cut-out stencil, leaving flat-color motifs (or motifs in reserve against colored ground)
- **stencil-applied metallic** — gold leaf or shell-gold (zer-mürekkep) applied through stencil, producing gold repeat-patterns
- **stencil borders as inserted leaves** — separate stencil-decorated leaves bound into or vassale-mounted in the manuscript

**Key figures and collections:**

- **Karamemi** (fl. 1545–66): chief illuminator of Sultan Süleyman's court; hand-painted naturalistic floral borders in Divan-ı Muhibbi (1565–66) served as prototypes for mechanically stenciled paper
- **Known examples**: Stuttgart alba amicorum (Württembergische Landesbibliothek, 98 sheets), Coburg, Kassel, BnF Paris, John Rylands MS 7046 (1531–33)
- **Global Deco Paper Project** (LMU Munich) — active research project on decorated paper classification including Ottoman material

**⚠ Timeline:** Gold stencilling extends into the 19th century (1829 Ottoman manuscript, Shapero) — not limited to the 16th-century "classic" period.

**⚠ Literature terminology overlap:** Some English-language scholarship (e.g., Blair, Muqarnas 17, 2000; Sotheby's auction catalogues) uses "silhouette paper" to describe what may be stenciled paper, or uses "stencilled silhouette paper" as a compound term. When reading secondary sources, verify which production technique is actually described rather than assuming terminological consistency.

### Mounting and special treatments

- **vassale** — window-mounting technique (text mounted in window cut from decorated paper)
- **yan kağıtları** — side papers (decorative papers flanking text block)
- **âharlı kâğıt** — sized/burnished paper (âhar = sizing agent; mühre = burnishing)
- **zerefşân kâğıt** — gold-sprinkled paper

### Margin decoration

- **cetvelleri yaldızlı** — gold ruling lines only (not decorated paper)
- **başlığı tezhipli** — illuminated headpiece only (not illuminated margins)
- **ebrulu mukavva** — marbled board covers (not marbled paper)

- **İran işi zerefşân ... mıkleli cilt / deri cilt** — Iranian-style gold-sprinkled leather binding; the full phrase confirms a gold-sprinkled cover, not paper decoration. Formula: "İran işi zerefşân [colour] deri mıkleli cilt" (confirmed: Kastamonu 459737)
