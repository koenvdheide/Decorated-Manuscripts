## Decoration Types

### Page-level elements

- **serlevha** / ʿunwān — illuminated headpiece at top of text opening
- **zahriye** — frontispiece, typically a full-page illuminated opening
- **cedvel** / jadwal — ruling and frame lines around text block
- **hâşiye** — marginal decoration
- **levha** — text panel
- **tığ** — finials / spike-like extensions from headpiece or medallion into margin
- **koltuk** — corner pieces / triangular margin fill between rectangular text block and arched frame
- **gül** — rosette (also used for verse markers in Qurans)
- **hâtime** / khātima — finispiece / colophon decoration; the ending counterpart to serlevha. Text typically tapers to a triangular point. Ottoman scribes often switch to dīwānī script for the colophon.
- **beyit arası tezhibi** / satır arası tezhibi — interlinear illumination: decorative elements occupying the spaces between written lines. Particularly associated with Safavid luxury production, though not exclusive to it. See also: bulut/abr-i band (cloud bands following script contours)
- **fasıl başı** / bahir başı / ara başlık — text dividers in non-Qur'anic manuscripts (chapter headings, section separators). Follows the logical structure of the text rather than fixed intervals.
- **serlevha anatomy** — the multi-register structure of an Ottoman headpiece, from top to bottom: **tığ zone** (delicate stalks with floral terminations), **kubbe zone** (scalloped dome surmounting rectangle), **rectangular headpiece panel** (main ʿunwān band with central cartouche), **koltuk zone** (illuminated side panels flanking text), **text well** (bordered area with text). Standard Ottoman serlevha: 3–4 registers; elaborate examples: 5–7 zones.

### Border system (pervaz / kenar suyu)

The Ottoman framing system uses layered borders around the text block:

- **iç pervaz** / **ara suyu** — inner border band (between text block cedvel and outer frame)
- **dış pervaz** / **kenar suyu** — outer border band (outermost frame around margins)
- **pervaz** — border (general); **dış pervazı** — outer border (for mounted calligraphy/painting)
- **hâşiye tezhibi** / **kenar suyu tezhibi** — marginal illumination / border illumination

### Marginal pictorial decoration

- **teşʿîr / tashʿīr** (تشعیر) — fine-line gold drawings in margins: animals, birds, plants, landscapes. Extremely delicate "hairline" work, typically gold on paper. Especially found in Persianate albums and luxury manuscripts. May be described in Turkish catalogues as "altın mürekkeple resim" or implied by "hayvan/şükûfe resimleri."

### Marginalia terms (search handles for margin-heavy manuscripts)

- **derkenar** (Ott., from Pers. dar-kanār) — marginal writing / note in the margin
- **hāmiš** (هامش, Ar.) — margin (physical space); also used for marginal glosses
- **kenar notu** (Ott.) — marginal note
- These are not decoration per se, but records noting "derkenar vardır" often indicate manuscripts with elaborate ruling/framing systems

### Mushaf gülleri (Qur'anic text markers)

Ottoman terminology groups all Qur'anic marginal markers under **mushaf gülleri** (مصحف گللری, "Qur'an rosettes"). These form a strict hierarchy:

- **durak** (دوراق) / gül-i fâsıla — verse-ending rosettes placed at the end of each verse. Arabic: ʿalāmat al-āya / fāṣila. Ottoman subtypes by form: *helezonî durak* (spiral), *şeşhâne durak* (six-compartment/hexagonal), *pençhâne durak* (five-compartment), *mücevher/geçme durak* (jewel/interlocking), *müzehhep durak* (gilded)
- **hamse gülü** (خمسه گلى) — marginal medallion at every 5th verse. Originally teardrop (*damla*), later pear-shaped (*armudî*)
- **aşere gülü** (عشره گلى) — marginal medallion at every 10th verse. Originally marked by ʿayn (ع); later circular illuminated forms
- **cüz gülü** (جزء گلى) — larger marginal medallion marking each of the 30 juz' divisions (~every 20 pages)
- **hizb gülü** (حزب گلى) — marginal medallion marking each of the 60 ḥizb divisions (2 per juz', ~every 10 pages)
- **secde gülü** (سجده گلى) — marginal medallion at the 14 prostration verses; typically contains "secde" in white on gold
- **sûre başı tezhibi** / ser-sûre (سوره باشى تذهيبى) — illuminated rectangular panel separating surahs, containing surah name, verse count, and revelation place. Associated marginal element: **sûre başı gülü** (medallion protruding from heading panel into margin)

### Calligraphic formats and special page types

- **tuğra** (طغرا) — the sultan's monogram. Five anatomical components: **sere/kürsü** (سره, base with sultan's name), **beyze** (بيضه, two oval loops), **tuğ** (طوغ, three vertical strokes), **zülfe** (ذلفه, S-shaped sinuous lines), **kol/hançer** (قول/خنجر, dagger-like horizontal extension). Illumination palette: gold and lapis lazuli with secondary red, green, white. Peak elaboration under Süleyman (Kara Memi style); perfected by Mustafa Râkım Efendi (1757–1826).
- **hilye-i şerîf** (حلیه شریف) — calligraphic portrait of the Prophet Muhammad. Six structural elements (named after body parts): **baş makam** (باش مقام, upper Basmala panel), **göbek** (گوبك, central roundel with physical description), **hilâl** (هلال, crescent space), **köşe yazıları** (corner medallions with Rashidun caliph names), **kuşak** (قوشاق, horizontal belt panel), **etek** (اتك, bottom panel with ketebe/date). Canonical layout created by Hâfız Osman (1642–1698). Believed to have talismanic properties.
- **müsenna / muthanná** (مثنى) — mirror calligraphy: text and its reflection placed symmetrically. Creates bilateral geometric, zoomorphic, or architectural compositions. Flourished in 18th–19th c. Bektashi/Sufi contexts.
- **icâzet / ijāza** (اجازت) — calligraphic diploma certifying mastery. Top: Basmala in thuluth; middle: demonstration text; lower: signed approvals (*taṣdīq*) of masters; *silsila* (chain of teachers). The script *rik'a* was called *icâzet yazısı* ("ijāza script").
- **qıt'a** (قطعه) vs. **levha** (لوحه) — qıt'a = calligraphic specimen panel for album mounting; levha = larger panel for wall display. Both feature illuminated panels, gold roundels, and decorative borders. Key distinction: levha = wall display; qıt'a = album (murakkaʿ) mounting.

### Binding decoration elements

- **şemse** / shamsa / toranj — central medallion (on bindings or pages)
- **salbek** / sar-toranj — pendant / tongue extending from şemse (primarily on binding covers)
- **tire / tîre** (تیره) — pendant extension projecting from marginal medallions on pages. Teardrop, flame-shaped, or lancet-shaped; typically 1/3 to 1/2 the height of parent medallion. Distinction from salbek: **salbek** = binding pendant from cover şemse; **tire** = page-level pendant from marginal gül markers. Subtypes: simple flame/teardrop, lobed, palmette, multi-tiered, axial vs. diagonal
- **köşebend** — corner pieces (on bindings)
- **zencirek / zencerek** (زنجيرك) — chain border: repeating interlinked ring/loop motifs in a narrow band. Applied to page edges, calligraphy panels, and binding edges.
- **ruganî / lake** — lacquer (for lacquer-painted bindings, Persian tradition). See also *roghanī* under Paper Decoration Techniques for lacquer painting on paper within manuscripts.

### Motif families

- **rūmī** — split-leaf palmettes (characteristic of Seljuk/Ottoman tradition)
- **hatāyī** — Chinese-derived lotus and peony forms
- **bulut** / cloud band — Chinese-derived cloud scrolls. Subtypes: **yığma bulut** (heaped cloud), **dolantı bulut** (winding cloud), **ayırma bulut** (separating cloud), **Çin bulutu** (Chinese cloud)
- **münhanî** — spiral / arabesque scrollwork
- **saz** — long serrated leaves with composite flowers (Ottoman court style)
- **penç** (پنج) — stylized bird's-eye/plan view of a fully opened flower. Central hub (*kaneviçe*) with radiating petals. Petal-count variants: *yekberk* (1), *düberk* (2), *seberk* (3), *ciharberk* (4), *pençberk* (5, most common), *şeşberk* (6), *sadberk* (many). **Çarkıfelek**: pinwheel variant with petals curving in one direction. The penç is the plan-view complement to hatāyī's elevation/profile view.
- **gonca / goncagül** (غنچه‌گل) — profile view of an unopened or partially opened bud, showing calyx (*çanak*) embracing petals. Directional motif. Represents the immature stage; hatāyī represents the fully opened flower.
- **yaprak** (یپراق) — stylized leaf forms as independent elements and building blocks. In saz compositions: **hançer yaprak** (dagger leaf) — large serrated leaves prominent in 16th-c. Karamemi style.
- **hataî gül** — hatāyī rose
- **girih** — geometric interlace patterns
- **islîmî** — arabesque; **islîmî-i mârī** — snake/dragon-derived arabesque (linked to cloud band origins)
- **lâle** — tulip; **karanfil** — carnation; **sümbül** — hyacinth; **gül** — rose; **şükûfe** — flowers (general, often in margin context). **Şükûfe** as period style: semi-naturalistic to realistic flower paintings emerging in the 18th c. under European influence (Lâle Devri / Tulip Era, 1718–1730); distinguished from classical motifs by realistic rendering, shading, and botanical accuracy.
- **ortabağ / agraf / düğüm / kenet** — junction ornaments: small binding motifs at stem intersections. "At these points, tepelik, knot, agraf are placed." Also *ortabağ bulut* (linking cloud elements between cloud forms).
- **ayırma** — dividing motifs used to partition compositional fields into separate color zones, creating the münâvebe (alternation) effect. Two main types: **ayırma rûmî** and **ayırma bulut**.
- **tepelik** — crown/cap motif at the apex of compositions. **Tepelik rûmî** (crown-form rūmī at top of closed forms and symmetry axis); **tepelik bulut** (crown-form cloud motif). Related: **tâcü'l-cedvel** (تاج الجدول, "crown of the frame") — decorative crown rising above the rectangular text frame.
- **çintemani** — three-dot and tiger-stripe pattern: three dots in a triangle combined with two wavy parallel lines. Derives from Central Asian Buddhist symbolism, became Ottoman sovereignty symbol. Appears sparingly in tezhip (more common in textiles/ceramics).

## Paper Decoration Techniques

### Gold-decorated papers

Terms defined in Gold Techniques table above. YEK cataloguing phrases for these techniques:

- **dendanlı olarak zer-efşanlıdır** — scalloped/crenellated gold-sprinkled (berat-specific phrase; *dendanlı* = toothed/crenellated, describing the edge or border treatment of the gold sprinkling)
- **kenarları serpme oksitlenmiş yaldız** — margins with sprinkled oxidized gold (notes both application technique and oxidation state)
- **ilk formaların derkenarları zerefşan tekniğiyle süslenmiştir** — margins of the first gatherings decorated with zerefşan technique (*forma* = quire/gathering; *derkenar* = margin)
- **zerefşân kâğıtla kaplanmıştır** — (endpapers) covered/lined with gold-sprinkled paper (*kaplanmıştır* = is covered/lined; distinguishes applied from directly decorated paper)
- **dış pervazı kalbur zer-efşanlıdır** — outer border/frame is sieve-sprinkled gold (*dış pervaz* = outer border/frame)
- **zerefşân taçlı salkım filigranı** — gold-sprinkled with a crown-bunch watermark; cataloguing phrase combining paper decoration type with watermark description in one field
- **çeşitli zerkâri kâğıt** — various gold-worked paper (cataloguing phrase used when a volume contains assorted gold-worked papers)
- **zerkâri-bordurlu** — with gold-worked border (combined descriptor for paper with gold-worked border treatment)
- **ilk iki sayfa zerkâri** — first two pages gold-worked (location-specific cataloguing phrase)
- **zerendûddur / sûre isimleri zerendûddur** — "are gold-painted" / "surah titles are gold-painted" (Quran surah-header and colophon context)
- **zer-ender-zer tekniği kullanılmıştır** — "gold-on-gold technique was used" (explicit genel_notlar phrasing for the zer-ender-zer technique)

### Color-splashed papers (boya efşân)

- **boya efşân / serpme-i boyalı** (بویا افشان) — pigment-sprinkled: colored paint or pigment particles hand-scattered onto paper surface using the same brush-flicking (fırça serpme) technique as zerefşân, but with colored pigment instead of gold leaf. The chromatic equivalent of zerefşân. Literally "color scattering" (*boya* = paint/dye, *efşân* = scattering, from Persian *afshān*). Also called *rangafshān* (رنگ‌افشان) in Persian ("color scattering").
- **Diagnostic distinction from zerefşân**: speckles are matte colored pigment (pink, red, blue, etc.) rather than metallic gold particles. No shimmer or metallic lustre under any lighting.
- **Diagnostic distinction from mülevven**: boya efşân produces scattered speckles on a cream/white ground; mülevven is uniformly dyed paper with no speckle pattern.
- **Known application patterns**: Full-page endpapers; narrow border strips within compound cedvel framing; scattered pink/rose speckles on individual folios.

### Marbled papers

- **ebrî / ebrulu** — marbled (general). Simple form `Ebru kağıt` also used as standalone kagit_ozellikleri descriptor
- **hatip ebru** — imam's marbling: floral/vegetal motifs created in marbling trough
- **battal ebru** — stone/spot marbling: irregular spotted or mottled pattern
- **gel-git ebru** — "come-go" marbling: wave-like patterns created by drawing a single stylus (biz) back and forth through pigment on the size. Produces flowing, organic S-curves. NOT combed.
- **taraklı ebru** — combed marbling: parallel lines created by drawing a multi-toothed comb (tarak) through the size. Produces regular, evenly-spaced striations. Distinct from gel-git.
- **vikaye yaprağı hatip ebrulu** — protective/guard flyleaf in hatip-marbled paper (flyleaf = vikaye yaprağı; confirms marbled paper at opening)
- **yan kağıtları ebrulu** — marbled side/margin papers (distinct from text block; found at both ends of volume — check opening AND closing pages when searching)
- **X.varak ebrulu kağıt üzeri yazılı** — folio X written on marbled paper (indicates scattered marbled leaves within a manuscript; targeted page navigation required)
- **vassale yöntemiyle ebrulu kağıda monte edilmiştir** — text panel window-mounted onto marbled paper via vassale technique (text block is separate from the decorated paper ground; see also *vassale* under §Mounting and special treatments)
- **[Master name]'nin ebrusu tarzında** — attributed hatip ebru in the manner of a named master (e.g. "Hatip Mehmet Efendi'nin neftli sarı örneği tarzındaki enfes ebrusu"); signals a named workshop or attribution claim
- **ebrulu mukavva** — marbled board/cover (⚠ NOT paper decoration — binding only)
- **ebrulu cilt** — marbled binding (⚠ NOT paper decoration)
- **kapaklar hatip ebrulu / kapak içleri ebrulu / kutusu ebrulu** — hatip-marbled binding covers / doublures / slipcase (⚠ FP patterns in kagit_ozellikleri — cataloguer error placing binding description in paper field)
- **satıhı hatip ebrusu kaplı cild** — hatip-marbled binding cover (⚠ FP formula; sentence always ends with "cild" or "ciltlidir"; confirmed Kastamonu pattern)

### Colored papers

- **mülevven** — colored paper. Simple standalone forms `Mülevven kağıt` (and `Abadî ve suyolu filigranli mülevven` — abadi paper with chain-line watermarks, colored) also used in kagit_ozellikleri
- **mülevven cedid** — new colored paper
- **boyalı** — dyed / painted paper
- **sarı boyalı** — yellow-dyed paper
- **renkli yaprak** — colored leaves (individual colored folios). Trailing forms: `yapraklar renkli` also used
- **bazı yapraklar lacivert, yeşil, sarı ve mavi** — multi-colored scattered leaves (lapis, green, yellow, blue)
- **lacivert** — lapis blue (paper color)

### Stenciled, silhouetted, and impressed papers

No standardized Turkish cataloguing term exists for any of these techniques. Discovery in YEK requires descriptive keyword probes or image-based triage.

**Three distinct techniques:**

- **stenciled paper** — pigment applied through pre-cut stencil templates (masks) onto the paper surface. Produces flat-color motifs with crisp edges. Diagnostic traces: stencil bridges (tiny unpainted connectors inside closed shapes), misregistration between color layers, edge haloing/overspray, pigment pooling at mask edges
- **silhouetted paper** — pattern impressed between sheets with a pigmented sheet in the middle; the pressure transfers both the pattern relief and the color, creating a distinctly shadowed appearance. The middle (pigmented) sheet acts as the color source. Distinguished from stenciling by the pressure-transfer process and characteristic soft-edged shadow effect rather than crisp mask edges
- **impressed / relief paper** — pattern created by pressing between engraved matrices WITHOUT pigment; produces shadow/relief effect through paper deformation alone. Similar to silhouetted paper but lacks the color transfer from a pigmented intermediate sheet

**Related technique (distinct category):**

- **block-printed paper** — separate technique using carved wooden blocks pressed onto paper; may show press indentation and ink transfer. Distinct from stenciling (no mask involved) and from silhouetting (the block carries the pigment directly, not an intermediate sheet)

**⚠ Pouncing vs. stenciling:** Pouncing (perforated cartoon + powder transfer) is a *layout* technique, not finished decoration — gets conflated with stenciling in some catalogues. Pounce marks are preparatory (under paint/gilding), not the final decorative surface.

**Stenciled paper subtypes by material:**

- **stencil-applied color** — pigment brushed/dabbed through cut-out stencil, leaving flat-color motifs (or motifs in reserve against colored ground)
- **stencil-applied metallic** — gold leaf or shell-gold (zermürekkep) applied through stencil, producing gold repeat-patterns
- **stencil borders as inserted leaves** — separate stencil-decorated leaves bound into or vassale-mounted in the manuscript

**Key figures:** Karamemi (fl. 1545–66), chief illuminator of Süleyman's court; naturalistic floral borders later informed or paralleled stencil-based repeat patterns. Reference: Global Deco Paper Project (LMU Munich).

**⚠ Timeline:** Gold stencilling extends into the 19th century (1829 Ottoman manuscript, Shapero; commercial record, scholarly confirmation desirable) — not limited to the 16th-century "classic" period.

**⚠ Literature terminology overlap:** Some English-language scholarship (e.g., Blair, Muqarnas 17, 2000; Sotheby's auction catalogues) uses "silhouette paper" to describe what may be stenciled paper, or uses "stencilled silhouette paper" as a compound term. When reading secondary sources, verify which production technique is actually described rather than assuming terminological consistency.

### Cut paper (qat'ī)

- **qaṭʿī** (قطعی, from *qaṭʿ* = "cutting") — cut-paper calligraphy: individual letters, dots, and syllables cut from paper with fine blades and pasted onto contrasting backgrounds. Light-toned cut-outs on dark grounds (or reverse). The finest examples simulate written calligraphy indistinguishably. Practitioners: *qāṭiʿān* (قاطعان, "cutters"). French: *découpage*.
- **Key masters**: Sangī ʿAlī Badakhshī, Mawlānā Naẕr ʿAlī Qaṭʿī, Shaykh ʿAbdallāh Haravī, Dūst-Muḥammad. Developed at the Timurid court workshop at Herat (late 15th c.). Flourished under Safavid patronage.
- **Identification**: Look for slight variations in paper tone/thickness between letters and background; seams at letter edges; contrasting colors; combination with müsennā and architectural framing (mihrab-shaped cutouts).

### Lacquer painting on paper (roghanī)

- **roghanī** (روغنی, "lacquered") / **naqāshī-yi roghanī** (لاکی نقاشی) — lacquer painting on paper. Lacquer material: *roghan-i kamān* or *lāk* (لاک), from shellac resin — distinct from East Asian tree-resin lacquer.
- **Layer structure**: pasteboard → fine white paper → first brownish shellac layer → watercolor/opaque pigments → final transparent shellac varnish. Paint is "sandwiched" between two shellac layers.
- **Distinction from regular miniature painting**: visible surface sheen/gloss; slight amber yellowing from shellac aging; network cracking (distinct from paint flaking); often on pasteboard substrate. Regular miniatures: matte gouache on sized paper without lacquer.
- **Traditions**: Safavid (16th–18th c.) — originated at Timurid Herat court of Sultan Husayn Bayqara; **Qajar** (1789–1925) — peak era with European-influenced portraiture. Interior page lacquer application is rare; the technique is more commonly associated with bindings. See also *ruganî / lake* under Binding decoration elements.

### Penwork (kalem işi)

- **kalem işi** (قلم ایشی, "pen work") / **kalem tezyīnātı** — decorative embellishments executed solely with pen and ink: NO gold leaf, NO opaque pigments, NO lapis lazuli grounds. Arabic: **taḥrīr** (تحریر, "delineation by pen"). Typically 1–3 ink colors (red most common, then blue, occasionally black/green). Simple geometric borders, pen-drawn florets and vine scrolls, headpiece suggestions with ink arabesques.
- **Most developed in the Maghribi tradition**: North African Qur'ans characteristically use polychrome ink for text and decoration — brown ink for text, diacritics in blue/yellow, voweling in mauve/purple, verse separators as gold and polychrome florets, surah headings in gold Kufic.
- Also common in provincial Ottoman manuscripts, less luxurious Mamluk copies, and sub-imperial Mughal/Indian manuscripts.

### Mounting and special treatments

- **vassale** — window-mounting technique (text mounted in window cut from decorated paper)
- **yan kağıtları** — side papers (decorative papers flanking text block)
- **âharlı kâğıt** — sized/burnished paper (âhar = sizing agent; mühre = burnishing)
- **zerefşân kâğıt** — gold-sprinkled paper

### Margin decoration

#### Halkâr cataloguing phrases (genel_notlar)

YEK cataloguers use varied grammatical forms; match on proximity of kenar/sayfa + halkâr keywords:

- **ilk sayfa kenarı halkârî** — first-page margin halkâr
- **derkenar halkârileriyle bezelidir** — decorated with margin halkâr paintings
- **kenarları halkârî yaldızlı** — margins with gold halkâr
- **halkârî bezemelerle süslenmiştir** — decorated with halkâr ornaments

Binding FP descriptors (⚠ NOT page margin halkâr):

- **halkârî gömme şemse** — halkâr sunken/recessed medallion (binding FP pattern)
- **halkârî salbek şemseli** — halkâr pendant-medallion (binding FP pattern)

#### Other margin decoration terms

See §Page-level elements, §Border system, and §Marginal pictorial decoration above. Additional search-handle terms: kenar bezemeli, kenar tezhibi, kenar süsleme, tezhipli kenar, altın cetvelli, cetvelli, süslemeli, bezemeli.

## Paper Provenance Terms

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |

### Chinese paper identification markers

Chinese luxury paper in Islamic manuscripts is most commonly documented in 15th-century Timurid manuscripts, arriving through Ming diplomatic gifts (1412, 1417, 1419). At least 15 examples are currently documented in the published literature. Key identification markers:

- **Fiber analysis** (definitive): The primary diagnostic fiber is paper mulberry (*Broussonetia papyrifera*), whose long fibers with transparent primary wall membranes stain violet/bluish-purple with Herzberg stain. Islamic rag fibers (linen, hemp, flax — also bast fibers) stain purplish pink to vivid red-purple. The distinction is fiber species and morphology, not fiber class: both traditions use bast fibers, but paper mulberry is absent from Islamic papermaking. Secondary Chinese fibers include ramie, bamboo, and cotton
- **Visual identification markers**: See visual-identification-guide.md §Chinese paper for perpendicular orientation, burnishing absence, Chinese subject matter, color palette, and gold types
- **References**: Sturkenboom (ERC GLOBAL DECO PAPER project, LMU Munich); Soucek 1988 (*Ars Orientalis*); Blair 2000 (*Muqarnas* 17); Yu 2021 (University of Chicago Press); Helman-Ważny (fiber analysis)

**⚠ Visual identification alone provides PROBABLE attribution, not confirmed.** Definitive identification requires fiber analysis. When visually suspected, record as "probable Chinese paper (kāġaẕ-i Ḫiṭāʾī)" with confidence ≤ 0.7 and note the need for fiber analysis.

## Binding Terms

### Structure

- **cilt** — binding (general)
- **mıklep** — flap (Ottoman flap binding)
- **sertab** — envelope flap
- **iç kapak** — doublure (inside cover)
- **mukavva** — board
- **āstar-e badraqa** (Pers.) — endpaper / doublure lining

### Cover decoration

- **soğuk şemse** — blind-stamped medallion (no gilding)
- **ruganî / lake** — lacquer binding (Persian tradition). See also roghanī under Paper Decoration Techniques for lacquer painting on paper.
- Other cover terms (şemse, köşebend, salbek, zencirek, çârkûşe): see yek-playbook.md FP Detection Rules for binding-context identification.

### Edge and endpaper decoration

- **yaldızlı kenar / ağız yaldızlı** — gilt edges (gold-leaf on bookblock edges)
- Marbled binding components (ebrulu mukavva, ebrulu iç kapak): see yek-playbook.md FP Detection Rules.

## Manuscript Format Terms

- **mecmû'a** — composite manuscript / anthology
- **kıt'a** / **katı'** — calligraphic specimen sheet
- **murakkaa** / **murakkaʿ** — calligraphy/painting album
- **vakfiye** — endowment deed
- **dîvân** — poetry collection
- **mesnevî** — narrative poem (in couplets)

- **levha** — calligraphic panel / broadsheet

These format terms are useful as search co-anchors: luxury formats (murakkaa, kıt'a, dîvân, mushaf) disproportionately feature decorated paper.

## Spelling Variants for Search

Cataloguers are inconsistent with Turkish diacritics. Always search both forms. The YEK portal explicitly instructs "Arama yaparken Türk Alfabesini kullanınız" (use the Turkish alphabet).

For the full spelling variant rotation table with search-behavior notes (diacritics, hyphens, spaces), see yek-playbook.md §Protocol E.

## YEK Cataloguing Field Terminology

These are the field names and values used in the YEK portal (portal.yek.gov.tr):

| Field | Turkish label | Contains |
| --- | --- | --- |
| kagit_ozellikleri | Kağıt Özellikleri | Paper characteristics |
| genel_notlar | Genel Notlar | General notes |
| tezhip_minyatur_harita_cizim | Tezhip/Minyatür/Harita/Çizim | Decoration/miniature/map field |

### Common YEK false positive terms

These describe features OTHER than decorated paper:

- **cetvelleri yaldızlı** — gold ruling lines only (not decorated paper)
- **başlığı tezhipli** — illuminated headpiece only (not illuminated margins)
- **ebrulu mukavva** — marbled board covers (not marbled paper)
- **ebrulu cilt** — marbled binding (not marbled paper)
- **filigran** — watermark description (not paper decoration)
- **serpme tezhiplidir / serpme tarzında tezhip** — "*serpme*" here modifies "*tezhip*" (illumination), meaning illumination motifs (palmettes/rosettes) scattered between text sections on plain paper, NOT gold-sprinkled paper
- **İran işi zerefşân ... mıkleli cilt / deri cilt** — Iranian-style gold-sprinkled leather binding; the full phrase confirms a gold-sprinkled cover, not paper decoration. Formula: "İran işi zerefşân [colour] deri mıkleli cilt" - **siyah serpme boyalı** — black sprinkled paint (*siyah* = black); a painting technique on covers or other surfaces, not gold-sprinkled decorated paper
- **serpme şekilde** — "in a scattered/dispersed manner"; *şekilde* = "in the manner of"; describes arrangement or layout, not physical gold sprinkling

## Compositional Grammar

Terms describing the structural logic and compositional techniques underlying Islamic manuscript illumination. These are not decoration "types" but rather the vocabulary for analyzing HOW illumination is constructed.

- **münâvebe** (مناوبه, "alternation") — systematic alternation of ground colors within decorative panels. Adjacent *pafta* (compartments) alternate between gold and lapis blue (lâcivert), or gold and crimson. Achieved through *ayırma* motifs and *kapalı form*. Circulates more in oral workshop tradition than published glossaries.
- **kapalı form** ("closed form") — enclosed compositional spaces created by interlocking stems. Each compartment can receive a different ground color, enabling münâvebe (alternation). The structural mechanism behind color variation in illuminated panels.
- **ulama desen** — repeat/rapport pattern: infinitely tileable designs used in zahriye, koltuk, and cover decoration.
- **lâcivert** (لاجورد) — not merely a color but a characteristic decorative ground: deep lapis lazuli blue serves as the fundamental partner to gold in classical tezhip. "Cobalt blue comes to the fore as the most commonly used background color after gold" (TDV İslâm Ansiklopedisi).
- **mühür** (مهر) — seal impressions as accumulated decorative layers. **Vakıf mühürü** (waqf seal), **temellük mühürü** (ownership seal). Not a decoration TYPE applied by the maker, but seals accumulate on flyleaves, title pages, and colophon folios over centuries, sometimes in deliberate decorative arrangements. Known Ottoman waqf seal examples date to the early 8th/14th century.
