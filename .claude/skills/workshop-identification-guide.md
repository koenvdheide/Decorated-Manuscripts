## Primary Fingerprints Per Tradition

### Timurid (Herat/Samarkand, c. 1400–1507)

#### Baysunghur's kitābkhāna, Herat (c. 1420–1433)

- Classical palette: turquoise, amethyst, lapis lazuli + extensive gold leaf
- Large page formats (Shahnameh of Baysunghur ~38 × 26 cm)
- Double-page illuminated frontispiece with blue-and-gold interlacing cartouches around gilded lobed medallions
- Ja'far al-Baysunghuri nastaliq: increased proportion, decreased roundness, shifted center of gravity
- Balanced, architectonic compositions with figures in multiple planes by vertical stacking
- Systematic copying of Jalayirid prototypes — "studied emulation" is itself a diagnostic trait

#### Late Herat under Husayn Bayqara (c. 1469–1506)

- Shift from epic formalism to lyrical intricacy (Balafrej's "aesthetics of intricacy")
- Bihzad innovations: geometry and architecture as compositional framework; psychological individualization of figures; compositions spread beyond text block
- Sultan Ali Mashhadi nastaliq replaces Ja'far style
- Dense minute tahrir (line work); signatures hidden in architectural inscriptions

#### Samarkand vs Herat distinction

- Samarkand: primarily scientific/historical texts in naskh; Samarkand-type paper (cotton fibers, visible clumps); the observatory rather than the library defined the city
- Herat: illustrated literary manuscripts (Shahnameh, Khamseh, divan) in refined nastaliq; "brown Herati paper"
- If scientific content + naskh + Samarkand paper → Samarkand more probable. If literary text + refined nastaliq + turquoise-amethyst-lapis palette + elaborate frontispiece → Herat

### Safavid (Tabriz/Qazvin/Isfahan, c. 1501–1736)

#### Tabriz under Shah Tahmasp (c. 1525–1555)

- Brilliantly polychromatic palette; **ultramarine (not azurite)** dominant in royal manuscripts
- Compositions extend beyond text frame into margins; figures, animals, rocks spill deliberately
- Gold skies — Sultan Muhammad trademark
- Jadval (ruling lines) incorporate bright green band alongside blue and gold, outlined in black
- **Taj-i Haydari** (Qizilbash headgear, 12 folds for 12 Shi'i imams) — political marker absent in Timurid or pre-Safavid manuscripts
- Synthesis of Turkmen/Aq Qoyunlu verve (dynamic colors, concealed grotesques) + Timurid/Herati balance (under Bihzad's influence from c. 1522)

#### Qazvin period (c. 1555–1598)

- Muted palette: brown and purple tertiary colors replace Tabriz's brilliant primaries
- Elongated figures with smaller rounded heads
- Emergence of single-page paintings and tinted drawings for muraqqa'
- Thinner gold application; experimental compositions
- Decentralized production — Haft Awrang of Jami produced across 3 cities by 5 calligraphers

#### Isfahan period (c. 1598 onwards)

- Shift from fully illustrated manuscripts to single-page album paintings (muraqqa')
- Fluid calligraphic line (Riza Abbasi): single or paired figures against lightly drawn backgrounds
- European influences (Farangi-Sazi style): perspective, shading, atmospheric effects
- Lacquer bookbinding becomes a major art form

#### Shiraz commercial production

- Small formats; repetitive stock compositions (poncifs)
- Round-faced figures with long noses; less complex pigment mixing
- Azurite sometimes substituted for ultramarine as cheaper alternative
- Mostly unsigned (unlike court productions)
- After 1501: taj headgear appears, reflecting Safavid political influence

### Mamluk (Cairo/Damascus, c. 1250–1517)

#### Bahri period (c. 1250–1382)

- Double-page frontispieces (carpet pages) with intricate geometric strapwork in gold and blue
- **10- and 12-pointed star medallions** with gold-and-white outlines forming trellis patterns — highly diagnostic
- **White Kufic within gilt panels on striking blue ground** — highly diagnostic feature for surah headings
- Script: **muhaqqaq**, bold and angular with extended horizontal strokes, typically 12 lines per page
- Gold rosettes marking verse endings; regularly spaced gold dots filling blank spaces
- Arabesques completely enclosing calligraphy

#### Burji period (c. 1382–1517)

- Script shifts from muhaqqaq to refined cursive **rayhani**
- Gold architectural structures containing liturgical instructions (e.g., "prostration" in blue Kufic)
- Layouts move from enclosed Bahri formats toward an impression of infinite space
- **30-part Qur'ans** standard (reflecting daily Ramadan recitation practice)
- Broader palette: increased red, green, polychrome; more complex and fluid arabesques

#### Cairo vs Damascus

- Difficult to distinguish without colophon evidence — many MSS catalogued as "Egypt or Syria"
- Egyptian muqarnas mouldings have **angular points**; Syrian have **rounded profiles**

### Ottoman (Istanbul and earlier Anatolian centres, c. 1450–1700)

#### Nakkaşhane-i hümayun (Imperial Design Workshop)

- Organized under the **Ehl-i Hiref** from late 15th c.; documented from 1525 Archives
- Başnakkaş (chief painter) managed projects; specialized divisions: musavvir nakkaş, müzehhip, tarrah, calligraphers, bookbinders
- Collaborative salaried production → **stylistic consistency** of output is itself a diagnostic marker
- **İğne delme** (pin-pricking for pattern transfer) → precise bilateral symmetry
- Sultan's tughra or dedicatory inscription present

#### Period progression

- **Mehmed II** (1451–81): Baba Nakkaş (Uzbek descent) founded workshop; Italian influences via Gentile Bellini (1479–80)
- **Bayezid II** (1481–1512): Sheikh Hamdullah established canonical Ottoman calligraphic style (aklam-i sitte); hatayi patterns first appear on tughra beyzes
- **Süleyman golden age** (1520–66): Three overlapping decorative vocabularies codified:
  - **Saz style** (Şahkulu, from Tabriz): long feathery sawtoothed leaves, composite blossoms, dragons and phoenixes in Chinese-influenced compositions
  - **Hatayi**: symmetrical peonies and buds in stages of bloom
  - **Rumi**: spiraling intertwining stems with stylized leaves (from Seljuk Anatolia)
- **Cintamani** (tri-dot + wavy lines) signifies power and sultanate
- Dominant Süleymanic palette: **gold and navy blue** with vivid red and green accents

## Named Masters Quick-Reference

| Master | Tradition / Period | Signature features | Key attribution anchor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

---

## Additional Traditions

### Ilkhanid Tabriz and Jalayirid Baghdad (c. 1256–1410)

- **Ilkhanid Tabriz**: monumental format (~57.6 × 39.7 cm); heavy **Chinese influence** (gnarled trees, wave-like rocks, curling cloud strips, dragon/lotus motifs); figures at monumental scale, often shown from behind; compositions extend beyond frame
- **Jalayirid Baghdad**: shift to intimate formats; puppetlike elegant figures on rich gold backgrounds; **qalam siyahi** (black pen technique — compositions in black ink with gray washes + touches of blue, brown, gold)
- **Jalayirid → Timurid continuity**: forced artist migration after Timur's conquests; Baysunghur's atelier systematically copied Jalayirid prototypes (Topkapı R.1022 copies H.362)

### Mughal India (c. 1526–1858)

- **Akbar** (c. 1570–1600): **red-ink marginal inscriptions** naming tarh (composition master), 'amal (colorist), and portraitist; crowded multi-figure narratives; warm saturated colors; Indian flora and dress
- **Jahangir** (c. 1605–27): strict profile portraiture with psychological depth; allegorical paintings; **gold floral margins on indigo-dyed paper**; Ustad Mansur's natural history precision
- **Shah Jahan** (c. 1628–58): durbar formula (emperor on jharokha balcony with large golden nimbus; hierarchical courtiers below)
- **Distinguish from Safavid**: Mughal 'unwans and shamsas show **three-dimensionality** — "seemingly flat circles of Timurid or Safavid tradition become swelling globes"
- **Note**: Mughal manuscripts are out of scope for this project's cataloguing but must be recognized to avoid misattribution

### Bukhara (c. 1500–1598)

- **Deliberately retardataire**: emulates 15th-c. Timurid Herat conventions decades after supersession at Safavid courts
- Three coexisting trends (Schmitz): Bihzad's Herat style (via Shaykhzada), derivative Safavid court style, indigenous Bukharan manner
- Later: stereotyped backgrounds with low hills, reduced figure counts (1–3 large figures), thinly applied pigments
- **Distinguish from Timurid**: lower pigment quality; later dates inconsistent with Timurid period; Bukhara paper characteristics

### Qajar Iran (19th c.)

- Continues Safavid decorative tradition with key material differences:
  - **Brass alloy (copper-zinc) widely substituted for gold** — primary diagnostic marker (detectable by SEM-EDS)
  - **Chrome green** (post-1810s pigment) — chronological marker
  - Large prominent headpieces (sarlavh) with regular rhythmic patterns
  - European influences: color gradation, shading, atmospheric perspective
- Under Nasir al-Din Shah: photography and lithography gradually supplanted manuscript illumination

### Maghribi and Andalusian

- **Maghribi script family**: pointed-tip pen producing lines of even thickness (contrasting with Eastern thick-thin variation); reversed notation of fa' and qaf — immediately recognizable
- **Multicolored vocalization system**: mauve/purple diacritics; yellow dots for diacritical points; green dots above initial alifs — highly diagnostic
- Parchment remained the preferred Qur'an medium far longer than in Eastern traditions
- Square text-block format
- **Andalusian markers**: zigzag marks along central fold of bifolia = definitive al-Andalus provenance; Pink Qur'an (13th c.) on tinted pink paper from Játiva with blue abjad verse numbers in gold discs
- Post-1492 (fall of Granada): Andalusi and Maghribi scripts merged, making distinction very difficult

## Script Type Diagnostics

**Scripts are likelihood signals conditioned on text genre — not hard rules.**

| Script | Meaning if found in Persian poetry | Meaning if found in Qur'an | Meaning if found in album/muraqqa |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nasta'liq | Strong signal: Timurid or Safavid | Weak signal: later Safavid is possible; otherwise unusual | Mixed scripts expected regardless of origin |
| Naskh | Notable — possible Ottoman or later copying tradition | Neutral: used in ALL traditions for Qur'an | Mixed — not informative |
| Thuluth | Headings only — common in Mamluk and Ottoman | Headings — Mamluk and Ottoman; less common in Persian | Mixed — not informative |
| Muhaqqaq | Rare; historically used in Timurid and Mamluk Qur'ans | Timurid or Mamluk context | N/A |
| Rayhani | Rare in this genre | Bahri-to-Burji Mamluk transition marker (replaces muhaqqaq) | N/A |
| Ta'liq | Ottoman or late Safavid context | Rare | Not informative |
| Maghribi | — | Immediately diagnostic: North African or Andalusian | — |

**Key correctives:**

- "Nasta'liq in a Qur'an" is NOT a Timurid/Safavid fingerprint — it is genuinely unusual and should be flagged with uncertainty
- "Naskh in a Persian divan" IS notable — consider Ottoman copying tradition or earlier Arabic-script context
- Safavid Qur'ans frequently use naskh — do not use naskh alone to exclude Safavid attribution

---

## Colour and Visual Appearance Diagnostics

> **Critical distinction**: Visual analysis from digital images cannot identify pigments. Separate "visually perceived colour" from "chemically identified pigment." Pigment identification requires scientific analysis (XRF, Raman, reflectance spectroscopy).

### How to phrase colour observations

- **Correct**: "Saturated blue backgrounds consistent with high-purity pigment use, as observed in analyzed Timurid examples (Knipe et al., 2018)"
- **Incorrect**: "Ultramarine blue = Timurid origin"
- **Correct**: "Copper-green tone consistent with verdigris or malachite-family compounds"
- **Incorrect**: "Emerald green pigment" — emerald green (copper acetoarsenite) is a 19th-century synthetic pigment. It cannot appear in pre-1814 manuscripts.

### Colour appearance patterns by tradition (as observed in analyzed examples)

| Colour feature | Associated tradition(s) | Caveats |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Saturated blue backgrounds (lapis-like) | Timurid, early Safavid | High-quality blue is not exclusive to any one tradition |
| Dark indigo blue + red palette | Mamluk (Knipe et al., 2018) | Indigo also appears in Persian manuscripts — not Mamluk-exclusive |
| Copper-green tones (verdigris/malachite-family) | Multiple traditions | Common across all; only useful when combined with other markers |
| Complex purples (indigo + red lake) | Safavid (Knipe et al., 2018) | Not exclusive |
| Abundant burnished gold with red/yellow underlayer | Mamluk Qur'ans | Some Timurid and Ottoman pieces also have yellow underpaint |
| Very fine gold detailing with high-purity metal | Ottoman court (Knipe et al., 2018) | Quality of gold is not visually measurable from images |

### Gold application style (more diagnostic than gold type)

Shell gold (ground gold in binder) is **universal across all traditions** — it is NOT a tradition marker. Use gold *application style* as a signal:

- **Gold-leaf backgrounds filling entire compartments**: Mamluk Qur'an illumination
- **Gold-speckled/sprinkled paper (serpme/zerefşân)**: Ottoman, some Safavid
- **Fine gold line-work arabesques in margins (halkâr)**: Ottoman and Timurid/Safavid shared
- **Gold ruling lines (cetvelli) without other gold work**: indicates framing convention, NOT decoration type

---

## Chronological Pigment Markers

These markers provide hard termini post quem for manuscript dating. They can only be confirmed through scientific analysis (XRF, Raman, SEM-EDS) — visual observation can suggest but not confirm.

| Marker | Terminus post quem | Diagnostic significance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prussian blue (iron ferrocyanide) | c. 1720 | First synthetic blue; indicates 18th c. or later |
| Emerald green (copper acetoarsenite) | c. 1814 | Cannot appear in pre-1814 manuscripts |
| Chrome green (Cr₂O₃) | c. 1810s | Strong Qajar marker when combined with other evidence |
| Barium sulfate (blanc fixe) as filler | 19th century | Industrial-era production marker |
| Brass alloy substituting for gold leaf | Primarily Qajar (post-1700) | Distinguishes Qajar from Safavid; also found in late/provincial work |

## Paper and Support Signals

> **All paper/support features must be treated as "consistent with" signals, never diagnostic alone. Always qualify by date range and manuscript genre.**

| Paper feature | Associated tradition / period | "Not diagnostic alone" note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blue-dyed paper support | Ottoman manuscripts, 16th–17th c. | Blue-dyed supports appear in other periods and regions; do not equate blue paper = Ottoman |
| Gilt-flecked or sprinkled edges | Safavid court taste, 16th–17th c. | Also found in high-quality Ottoman and later Mughal manuscripts |
| Burnished tan/cream paper, highly polished | Mamluk Egyptian/Syrian production | Surface burnishing is not exclusive — many Ottoman papers are also highly burnished |
| Polished rag paper, linen/hemp fibre | Common to Timurid and high-quality Ottoman | Fibre identification requires physical examination; not visible digitally |
| Watermarks | May indicate European or later paper imports | Presence of watermark ≠ European origin of manuscript |
| Samarkand-type paper (cotton fibers, visible fiber clumps) | Timurid Samarkand; also later Central Asian | Not visually distinguishable from all cotton papers without fiber analysis |
| Syro-Egyptian paper (chain lines in groups of 2–3) | Mamluk (Cairo/Damascus) | Requires transmitted-light examination |
| European imports (evenly spaced chain lines, watermarks) | Post-15th c., any tradition | Crescent moon watermarks were made specifically for Islamic-market export |
| Cucumber-seed sizing | 16th–17th c. Persian (Barkeshli et al.) | Starch sizing predominant from 18th c. onward; requires chemical analysis |

Pigment variation *within a single manuscript* is normal and expected — one folio may use indigo where another uses a more saturated blue. Do not base tradition attribution on a single folio's palette.

> The **misṭara (ruling board)** is among the most powerful workshop-attribution tools: each board produces a unique pattern of line spacings. Multiple manuscripts ruled with the same board can be linked to the same workshop (Déroche 2006). This requires physical examination or very high-resolution imaging.

---

## Binding Style Diagnostics

Binding is often the most tradition-specific physical feature, though bindings can be replaced:

| Binding form | Associated tradition | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Islamic flap binding (mıklep) + gilt-stamped leather, central roundel + corner pieces | Mamluk (Cairo/Damascus) | Early Ottoman also uses flap binding |
| Painted lacquer covers | Safavid court (Tabriz, Qazvin, Isfahan) | Distinctive and relatively reliable marker for Safavid court production |
| Stiff maroon or blue goatskin + large gilt central medallion with frame | Ottoman court (16th–17th c. Istanbul) | Later Ottoman may vary |
| Persian tooled leather + central medallion + pendants (salbek) | Timurid and Safavid (shared tradition) | Not distinguishable between the two from binding alone |
| Plain or fore-edge flap, minimal tooling | Any tradition — budget or later production | No attribution value |

**Caution**: Many manuscripts were rebound in later centuries. A Mamluk text block may survive in an Ottoman binding. Always note whether binding is consistent with manuscript date, and flag discrepancies.

---

## Diagnostic Masterworks

Benchmark manuscripts for calibrating tradition attribution. Use as comparison anchors when analyzing unfamiliar specimens.

| Manuscript | Tradition / Period | Format | Key diagnostic features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shahnameh of Baysunghur (Topkapı) | Timurid, Herat c. 1430 | ~38 × 26 cm | Double-page frontispiece; turquoise-amethyst-lapis; Ja'far nastaliq |
| Cairo Bustan (Egyptian National Library, 1488) | Timurid, late Herat | — | 4 genuine Bihzad signatures; architecture-as-composition |
| Tahmasp Shahnameh / Houghton Shahnameh (dispersed) | Safavid, Tabriz c. 1525–35 | ~48 × 32 cm, 759 ff. | 258 miniatures; ultramarine dominant; Sultan Muhammad gold skies |
| Haft Awrang of Jami (Freer, 1556–65) | Safavid, Qazvin | — | Decentralized production: 3 cities, 5 calligraphers |
| Baybars al-Jashnagir Qur'an (BL, 1304–06) | Mamluk, Bahri | 7 volumes | White Kufic on blue; gold rosettes; muhaqqaq 12 lines/page |
| Great Mongol Shahnameh (dispersed, c. 1330s) | Ilkhanid, Tabriz | ~57.6 × 39.7 cm | Monumental Chinese influence; figures from behind |
| Surname-i Hümayun (Topkapı, 1582) | Ottoman, Istanbul | — | 250 double-page illustrations; Nakkaş Osman; festival scenes |
| Varka and Gulshah (Topkapı H.841, c. 1250) | Seljuk, Anatolia | Horizontal format | Earliest illustrated Persian literary MS; rumi motif origin |

---

## Cross-Tradition Caveats

These patterns produce systematic misattributions and must be checked before finalizing any attribution:

1. **Tabriz → Anatolia (post-1501)**: Safavid-trained painters and illuminators migrated to Ottoman workshops after Shah Isma'il's consolidation. Safavid saz motifs and figural styles therefore appear in 16th-century Ottoman manuscripts.

2. **Herat → Bukhara**: Timurid Herat painters moved to Bukhara after the Uzbek conquest (c. 1507). Bukhara manuscripts continue Herat-style illumination into the 16th c. — "retardataire" style makes dating particularly difficult (Schmitz).

3. **Cloudband (bulut) motif is pan-Islamic**: Chinese-derived cloudbands appear in Timurid, Safavid, AND Ottoman illumination. Cloudband alone has no attribution value.

4. **Cintamani (tri-dot) appears in both Ottoman and Safavid influence zones**: strongest as Ottoman indicator when combined with tulip/rose naturalistic motifs and Ottoman binding; weaker in isolation.

5. **Persian works in Ottoman Topkapi Palace**: Many Timurid and Safavid manuscripts entered Ottoman royal collections after military conquests. Physical presence in Istanbul does not equal Ottoman production. Provenance labels can be misleading.

6. **Shared techniques — shell gold**: Used universally. The gold application method alone tells you nothing about tradition.

7. **Later restoration campaigns**: Borders, margins, and bindings may be replaced or supplemented by a later workshop in a different tradition. Inconsistencies between text-block and decorative programme should be noted explicitly.

8. **Silver tarnishing**: Tarnished silver-sprinkled paper (gümüş serpme) can resemble dark ink staining. Distinguish by looking for the metallic flake pattern characteristic of sprinkled papers.

9. **Mughal vs. Safavid**: Early Mughal painting derives directly from Safavid Tabriz (Humayun brought painters to India). Pre-1580s Mughal work can closely resemble Safavid. Key distinctions: red-ink marginal inscriptions naming artists (Akbar workshop practice), Indian flora and dress elements, three-dimensional shamsas.

10. **Qajar vs. Safavid continuity**: Qajar illumination deliberately continues Safavid forms. The primary distinction is material (brass-for-gold, chrome green pigment, European-influenced shading) rather than decorative vocabulary. Without scientific analysis, dating the Safavid–Qajar boundary can be very difficult.

11. **Ilkhanid Chinese influence vs. Chinese paper**: The Great Mongol Shahnameh shows heavy Chinese **stylistic** influence but is NOT on imported Chinese paper. Chinese-style decoration (wave-rocks, cloud strips, lotus) is Ilkhanid/Timurid stylistic influence; actual Chinese paper is a separate 15th-c. phenomenon tied to Ming diplomatic gifts (see `references/chinese_paper.md`).

---

## Attribution Workflow

Apply these steps in sequence. Each step narrows the tradition space; none is individually decisive.

1. **Colophons and inscriptions**: Check for date, place, patron, scribe name, and workshop signals (nakkaşhane-i hümayun, names of workshops). Check library stamps (Topkapi, Süleymaniye — presence in these libraries is not attribution).

2. **Script type**: Identify the script and condition on text genre (see Script Type Diagnostics above).

3. **Page layout**: Measure text-block proportion to page. Mamluk Qur'an pages are typically large format with ~12 lines and wide gold borders. Safavid divans often have many lines per page. Ottoman albums are mixed.

4. **Illumination motifs**: Identify dominant motif vocabulary against the fingerprints table. Single-motif matches (cloudband alone, geometric medallion alone) are weak. Multiple converging motif matches are stronger.

5. **Colour appearance**: Note the overall palette tone (saturated/cool blue, indigo-dominant, copper-green register) using the colour appearance table. Frame as "consistent with" — never as decisive identification.

6. **Paper and material signals**: Note paper colour, surface treatment, edge treatment. Apply the "not diagnostic alone" rule to each feature.

7. **Binding**: Note binding type, cover material, tooling pattern. Check for consistency with the text-block date.

8. **Comparison with documented exemplars**: Consult published catalogues (Metropolitan Museum, British Library, Topkapi collections) and the project's existing `catalog/` records. Look for motif-by-motif parallels in securely attributed manuscripts. Use the Diagnostic Masterworks table above as calibration anchors.

9. **Contextual consistency**: Consider text content. A Persian epic is more likely Timurid/Safavid; an Arabic Qur'an could be Mamluk, Ottoman, or Safavid. Style and content should be mutually consistent; flag any mismatch.

10. **Assign confidence**: Use the confidence tiers below. When tradition boundary is ambiguous (e.g., Bukhara vs. Safavid; early Ottoman vs. Safavid-influenced Ottoman), present two hypotheses ranked by likelihood.

---

## Confidence Guidance

| Score | Level | Meaning for tradition attribution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.9–1.0 | High | Multiple convergent markers; consistent with securely dated exemplars; no significant cross-tradition ambiguities |
| 0.7–0.89 | Moderate | Several matching features but at least one marker is shared with another tradition; minor cross-tradition caveats apply |
| 0.5–0.69 | Low-moderate | Tradition is plausible but shared visual vocabulary makes it uncertain; competing hypotheses should be stated |
| 0.3–0.49 | Low | Attribution is tentative; key diagnostic features are absent or ambiguous; alternative traditions not excluded |
| 0.0–0.29 | Very low / uncertain | Insufficient evidence for any tradition claim; record as `uncertain` |

**Framing convention**: Always phrase tradition attributions as:

- Strong: "characteristic of [tradition], [period]" (score ≥ 0.8)
- Moderate: "consistent with [tradition], [period]" (score 0.6–0.79)
- Weak: "possibly [tradition]; alternative attribution to [X] cannot be excluded" (score < 0.6)
