| **Active period** | c. 1400–1507 CE | c. 1501–1736 CE | c. 1250–1517 CE | c. 1450–1700 CE (peak) |
| **Primary scripts** | Nasta'liq (Persian texts); muhaqqaq or naskh for Qur'ans | Fine Nasta'liq (court); naskh/ta'liq for Persian texts | Arabic naskh (large, rounded); Thuluth or Kufic headings | Ottoman naskh + Thuluth; later ta'liq; royal court naskh |
| **Illumination motifs** | Medallion-and-corner; Chinese-derived cloudbands; lavish arabesques; monumental landscape figures | Rumi-style floral scrolls; saz leaf/bud patterns; circular medallions and pendants; simurgh; court scenes | Geometric frames; lotus-palmette scrolls; star/hexagonal rosettes as verse markers; gold-leaf backgrounds; no figural content (in Qur'ans) | Ottoman saz foliage; tulip/rose patterns; cintamani (tri-dot); cloudbands; hilye calligraphic panels in margins |
| **Colour appearance** | Saturated blue backgrounds; copper-green tones; carmines; extensive gold backgrounds | Deep blues; copper greens; vivid reds; organic yellows; complex purples; very fine gold details | Dark blue + red; brass-derived green; abundant burnished gold; gold sometimes over orpiment underlayer | Similar to early Safavid; later productions show broader pigment variety; extensive gold highlighting |
| **Paper & support** | High-quality polished rag paper (linen/hemp); occasional Chinese or Turkish imports | Finest Iranian papers (Tabriz, Isfahan); some gilt-flecked or dyed edges in court manuscripts | Egyptian/Syrian woven-pulp papers; highly burnished, tan-coloured surfaces; repetitive laid patterns | Turkish linen-pulp papers; blue-dyed edges in some 16th–17th c. manuscripts |

## Primary Fingerprints Per Tradition

### Timurid (Herat/Samarkand, c. 1400–1507)

- **Nasta'liq for Persian poetry** combined with Chinese-style cloudbands in illuminated borders
- **Saturated lapis-blue backgrounds** in miniature paintings with elongated, elegant figures
- **Central medallion + corner pieces** with fine arabesque infill in illuminated openings

### Safavid (Tabriz/Qazvin/Isfahan, c. 1501–1736)

- **Saz leaf and bud patterns** in borders and margins — the primary Safavid decorative vocabulary
- **Simurgh (phoenix)** as a recurring motif in illumination and painting
- **Painted lacquer bindings** — characteristic of Safavid court production
- **Dynamic figural court scenes** with vibrant colour and naturalistic landscape elements

### Mamluk (Cairo/Damascus, c. 1250–1517)

- **Bold Arabic naskh Qur'an script** (large, round letterforms) with Thuluth headings
- **Star-polygon verse rosettes** — the single most diagnostic Mamluk Qur'an marker
- **Geometric goldwork**: interlaced star patterns, hexagonal grids, and lotus-palmette bands in illumination
- **No figural content** in religious manuscripts; decoration is entirely geometric and vegetal

### Ottoman (Istanbul and earlier Anatolian centres, c. 1450–1700)

- **Cintamani (tri-dot)** motif in borders and ground patterns
- **Tulip and rose naturalistic motifs** alongside saz foliage inherited from Safavid tradition
- **Stiff goatskin binding** (maroon or blue) with large gilt central medallion
- **Naskh + Thuluth together** in devotional and Qur'anic manuscripts

## Script Type Diagnostics

**Scripts are likelihood signals conditioned on text genre — not hard rules.**

| Script | Meaning if found in Persian poetry | Meaning if found in Qur'an | Meaning if found in album/muraqqa |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nasta'liq | Strong signal: Timurid or Safavid | Weak signal: later Safavid is possible; otherwise unusual | Mixed scripts expected regardless of origin |
| Naskh | Notable — possible Ottoman or later copying tradition | Neutral: used in ALL traditions for Qur'an | Mixed — not informative |
| Thuluth | Headings only — common in Mamluk and Ottoman | Headings — Mamluk and Ottoman; less common in Persian | Mixed — not informative |
| Muhaqqaq | Rare; historically used in Timurid and Mamluk Qur'ans | Timurid or Mamluk context | N/A |
| Ta'liq | Ottoman or late Safavid context | Rare | Not informative |

**Key correctives:**

- "Nasta'liq in a Qur'an" is NOT a Timurid/Safavid fingerprint — it is genuinely unusual and should be flagged with uncertainty
- "Naskh in a Persian divan" IS notable — consider Ottoman copying tradition or earlier Arabic-script context
- Safavid Qur'ans frequently use naskh — do not use naskh alone to exclude Safavid attribution

## Colour and Visual Appearance Diagnostics

> **Critical distinction**: Visual analysis from digital images cannot identify pigments. Separate "visually perceived colour" from "chemically identified pigment." Pigment identification requires scientific analysis (XRF, Raman, reflectance spectroscopy).

### How to phrase colour observations

- **Correct**: "Saturated blue backgrounds consistent with high-purity pigment use, as observed in analyzed Timurid examples (Knipe et al., 2018)"
- **Incorrect**: "Ultramarine blue = Timurid origin"
- **Correct**: "Copper-green tone consistent with verdigris or malachite-family compounds"
- **Incorrect**: "Emerald green pigment" — emerald green (copper acetoarsenite) is a 19th-century synthetic pigment. It cannot appear in pre-1814 manuscripts.

### Colour appearance patterns by tradition (as observed in analyzed examples)

| Colour feature | Associated tradition(s) | Caveats |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Saturated blue backgrounds (lapis-like) | Timurid, early Safavid | High-quality blue is not exclusive to any one tradition |
| Dark indigo blue + red palette | Mamluk (Knipe et al., 2018) | Indigo also appears in Persian manuscripts — not Mamluk-exclusive |
| Copper-green tones (verdigris/malachite-family) | Multiple traditions | Common across all; only useful when combined with other markers |
| Complex purples (indigo + red lake) | Safavid (Knipe et al., 2018) | Not exclusive |
| Abundant burnished gold with red/yellow underlayer | Mamluk Qur'ans | Some Timurid and Ottoman pieces also have yellow underpaint |
| Very fine gold detailing with high-purity metal | Ottoman court (Knipe et al., 2018) | Quality of gold is not visually measurable from images |

### Gold application style (more diagnostic than gold type)

Shell gold (ground gold in binder) is **universal across all traditions** — it is NOT a tradition marker. Use gold *application style* as a signal:

- **Gold-leaf backgrounds filling entire compartments**: Mamluk Qur'an illumination
- **Gold-speckled/sprinkled paper (serpme/zerefşân)**: Ottoman, some Safavid
- **Fine gold line-work arabesques in margins (halkâr)**: Ottoman and Timurid/Safavid shared
- **Gold ruling lines (cetvelli) without other gold work**: indicates framing convention, NOT decoration type

## Paper and Support Signals

> **All paper/support features must be treated as "consistent with" signals, never diagnostic alone. Always qualify by date range and manuscript genre.**

| Paper feature | Associated tradition / period | "Not diagnostic alone" note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blue-dyed paper support | Ottoman manuscripts, 16th–17th c. | Blue-dyed supports appear in other periods and regions; do not equate blue paper = Ottoman |
| Gilt-flecked or sprinkled edges | Safavid court taste, 16th–17th c. | Also found in high-quality Ottoman and later Mughal manuscripts |
| Burnished tan/cream paper, highly polished | Mamluk Egyptian/Syrian production | Surface burnishing is not exclusive — many Ottoman papers are also highly burnished |
| Polished rag paper, linen/hemp fibre | Common to Timurid and high-quality Ottoman | Fibre identification requires physical examination; not visible digitally |
| Watermarks | May indicate European or later paper imports | Presence of watermark ≠ European origin of manuscript |

Pigment variation *within a single manuscript* is normal and expected — one folio may use indigo where another uses a more saturated blue. Do not base tradition attribution on a single folio's palette.

## Binding Style Diagnostics

Binding is often the most tradition-specific physical feature, though bindings can be replaced:

| Binding form | Associated tradition | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Islamic flap binding (mıklep) + gilt-stamped leather, central roundel + corner pieces | Mamluk (Cairo/Damascus) | Early Ottoman also uses flap binding |
| Painted lacquer covers | Safavid court (Tabriz, Qazvin, Isfahan) | Distinctive and relatively reliable marker for Safavid court production |
| Stiff maroon or blue goatskin + large gilt central medallion with frame | Ottoman court (16th–17th c. Istanbul) | Later Ottoman may vary |
| Persian tooled leather + central medallion + pendants (salbek) | Timurid and Safavid (shared tradition) | Not distinguishable between the two from binding alone |
| Plain or fore-edge flap, minimal tooling | Any tradition — budget or later production | No attribution value |

**Caution**: Many manuscripts were rebound in later centuries. A Mamluk text block may survive in an Ottoman binding. Always note whether binding is consistent with manuscript date, and flag discrepancies.

## Cross-Tradition Caveats

These patterns produce systematic misattributions and must be checked before finalizing any attribution:

1. **Tabriz → Anatolia (post-1501)**: Safavid-trained painters and illuminators migrated to Ottoman workshops after Shah Isma'il's consolidation. Safavid saz motifs and figural styles therefore appear in 16th-century Ottoman manuscripts.

2. **Herat → Bukhara**: Timurid Herat painters moved to Bukhara after the Uzbek conquest (c. 1507). Bukhara manuscripts continue Herat-style illumination into the 16th c. — "retardataire" style makes dating particularly difficult (Schmitz).

3. **Cloudband (bulut) motif is pan-Islamic**: Chinese-derived cloudbands appear in Timurid, Safavid, AND Ottoman illumination. Cloudband alone has no attribution value.

4. **Cintamani (tri-dot) appears in both Ottoman and Safavid influence zones**: strongest as Ottoman indicator when combined with tulip/rose naturalistic motifs and Ottoman binding; weaker in isolation.

5. **Persian works in Ottoman Topkapi Palace**: Many Timurid and Safavid manuscripts entered Ottoman royal collections after military conquests. Physical presence in Istanbul does not equal Ottoman production. Provenance labels can be misleading.

6. **Shared techniques — shell gold**: Used universally. The gold application method alone tells you nothing about tradition.

7. **Later restoration campaigns**: Borders, margins, and bindings may be replaced or supplemented by a later workshop in a different tradition. Inconsistencies between text-block and decorative programme should be noted explicitly.

8. **Silver tarnishing**: Tarnished silver-sprinkled paper (gümüş serpme) can resemble dark ink staining. Distinguish by looking for the metallic flake pattern characteristic of sprinkled papers.

## Attribution Workflow

Apply these steps in sequence. Each step narrows the tradition space; none is individually decisive.

1. **Colophons and inscriptions**: Check for date, place, patron, scribe name, and workshop signals (nakkaşhane-i hümayun, names of workshops). Check library stamps (Topkapi, Süleymaniye — presence in these libraries is not attribution).

2. **Script type**: Identify the script and condition on text genre (see Script Type Diagnostics above).

3. **Page layout**: Measure text-block proportion to page. Mamluk Qur'an pages are typically large format with ~15 lines and wide gold borders. Safavid divans often have many lines per page. Ottoman albums are mixed.

4. **Illumination motifs**: Identify dominant motif vocabulary against the fingerprints table. Single-motif matches (cloudband alone, geometric medallion alone) are weak. Multiple converging motif matches are stronger.

5. **Colour appearance**: Note the overall palette tone (saturated/cool blue, indigo-dominant, copper-green register) using the colour appearance table. Frame as "consistent with" — never as decisive identification.

6. **Paper and material signals**: Note paper colour, surface treatment, edge treatment. Apply the "not diagnostic alone" rule to each feature.

7. **Binding**: Note binding type, cover material, tooling pattern. Check for consistency with the text-block date.

8. **Comparison with documented exemplars**: Consult published catalogues (Metropolitan Museum, British Library, Topkapi collections) and the project's existing `catalog/` records. Look for motif-by-motif parallels in securely attributed manuscripts.

9. **Contextual consistency**: Consider text content. A Persian epic is more likely Timurid/Safavid; an Arabic Qur'an could be Mamluk, Ottoman, or Safavid. Style and content should be mutually consistent; flag any mismatch.

10. **Assign confidence**: Use the confidence tiers below. When tradition boundary is ambiguous (e.g., Bukhara vs. Safavid; early Ottoman vs. Safavid-influenced Ottoman), present two hypotheses ranked by likelihood.

## Confidence Guidance

| Score | Level | Meaning for tradition attribution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.9–1.0 | High | Multiple convergent markers; consistent with securely dated exemplars; no significant cross-tradition ambiguities |
| 0.7–0.89 | Moderate | Several matching features but at least one marker is shared with another tradition; minor cross-tradition caveats apply |
| 0.5–0.69 | Low-moderate | Tradition is plausible but shared visual vocabulary makes it uncertain; competing hypotheses should be stated |
| 0.3–0.49 | Low | Attribution is tentative; key diagnostic features are absent or ambiguous; alternative traditions not excluded |
| 0.0–0.29 | Very low / uncertain | Insufficient evidence for any tradition claim; record as `uncertain` |

**Framing convention**: Always phrase tradition attributions as:

- Strong: "characteristic of [tradition], [period]" (score ≥ 0.8)
- Moderate: "consistent with [tradition], [period]" (score 0.6–0.79)
- Weak: "possibly [tradition]; alternative attribution to [X] cannot be excluded" (score < 0.6)
