The paper presents in two closely related color variants: (1) a doublure variant with bold pink and aubergine/mauve-purple pomegranate forms; (2) an interior/margin variant with red/coral and dark-outlined forms on cream. The technique is block-printing or silhouetting with flat-color application and crisp, repeating motif units. YEK catalogue entries kagit_ozellikleri and tezhip_minyatur are both null; all decoration evidence derives from visual examination of IIIF images. Cataloguing by YEK: Nalan Kutsal. NOTE: IIIF page count (14) differs from folio count (12) in the catalogue — the two additional pages correspond to the two binding covers (front and back) photographed as separate IIIF pages."

    "summary": "TIEM 02482 deploys at least four distinct decorated paper types across its 14 pages, making it one of the most technique-diverse albums in the TIEM murakka corpus after TIEM 02471. The primary and most visually distinctive type is a large-scale repeating floral paper with bold pomegranate/peony-like forms executed in flat color with serrated leaf infill — present in two color variants on the doublures and as outer margin paper throughout the calligraphy openings. This paper is classified as block-printed or silhouetted on the basis of its extreme regularity of repeat, crisp outlines, flat color application, and consistent motif scale (no evidence of hand-painting irregularity). The technique cannot be resolved to block-printing vs. silhouetting without physical examination. (1) DOUBLURE VARIANT (p002 left, p013 left): Large pomegranate-derived forms in two tones — bold pink rounded lobes and aubergine/mauve-purple larger forms with densely stippled internal filling — on a cream ground with sinuous interlacing leaf-stems filling the interstices. The scale of the repeat is approximately 7–9 cm per motif unit, creating a bold, high-contrast pattern. (2) INTERIOR/MARGIN VARIANT (p002 right strip; p003 both sides; additional interior pages): The same repeating pomegranate/floral motif in a different colorway — red/coral primary forms and dark grey/charcoal detailed outlined forms on cream ground. This variant is deployed as the full outer margin paper for the calligraphy openings, framing the mounted calligraphy panels. The two variants share the same underlying motif structure and identical repeat geometry, confirming they derive from the same block or stencil set with different color applications. In addition to the primary floral paper: (3) MARBLED PAPER (p007 left): A green-grey marbled outer margin in muted sage-green, grey, and cream tones. The marbling type appears to be battal ebru (stone/spot) or a lightly combed gel-git variant; the muted palette and organic forms are consistent with Ottoman marbled paper of the period. (4) ZEREFŞÂN / GOLD-SPRINKLED (p007 right outer margin): Very fine gold speckling visible on the outer margin area of the right page — consistent with zerefşân (gold-sprinkled) margin paper, though resolution limits absolute certainty. (5) COLORED PAPER (p003 right calligraphy panel): The right calligraphy panel on p003 is written on a pink/salmon-colored ground paper rather than the standard cream of the other panels — indicating the use of mülevven (colored) calligraphy paper for at least one text piece. The binding is a multi-layer gilt-framed red leather cover (see codicology) with no lacquer or marbled paper elements; decorated papers are entirely interior.",
    "distribution_notes": "The block-printed/silhouetted floral paper occupies the structurally most prominent positions in the album: both doublures (pp. 002 left, 013 left) and both sides of the calligraphy opening margins throughout the interior pages (pp. 003, and likely additional interior openings not fully examined). The marbled and zerefşân papers appear at mid-album (p007), introducing variety into the otherwise consistent floral-paper program. The colored pink calligraphy panel (p003 right) is an isolated instance of mülevven paper as a writing surface rather than a margin material. The final pages of the album (pp. 013 right, 014) consist of a plain cream flyleaf and the back cover respectively, with no additional decorated paper.",

      "confidence": 0.80,
      "reasoning": "The key diagnostic features for mechanical (non-hand-painted) production are: (1) extreme regularity of the motif repeat — identical pomegranate forms at consistent intervals across the full page; (2) crisp, clean outlines without the soft edges or color bleeding characteristic of hand-painting or hatip-style marbling; (3) flat, even color fill within each motif — no tonal gradation; (4) the presence of two distinct colorways sharing identical repeat geometry, consistent with the same block or stencil applied with different pigments. The distinction between block-printing (inked block pressed onto paper) and silhouetting (pigmented paper sandwiched under a patterned intermediate sheet) cannot be resolved at IIIF resolution. Block-printing is favored (0.65) over silhouetting (0.30) and stenciling (0.05) on the grounds that the outlined forms with flat fill more closely match block-print than silhouette shadow-transfer patterns; physical examination (press indentation, verso show-through, pigment penetration analysis) is required for definitive determination.",
      "alternative_technique": "Stenciled paper is a remote alternative (0.05); the large scale of the motifs and the crisp outlines are more consistent with block-printing or silhouetting."

Between and around the main forms, sinuous stems and serrated elongated leaves fill the interstices on the cream ground. The motif scale is large — approximately 7–9 cm per complete repeat unit at the page height of 275 mm — creating a bold, high-contrast overall effect.

The gold speckling is subtle at IIIF resolution; the identification is tentative and subject to confirmation at higher resolution or physical examination. The combination of a marbled left margin and a zerefşân right margin on a single opening is a compositional decision introducing variety after the consistent block-printed margin program of earlier pages.",
