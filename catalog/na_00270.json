    "notes": "This album is one of the most palette-diverse marbled meşk albums in the project corpus. The triage originally described it as 'blue mulevven (lacivert) margins throughout entire album' — this is a significant mis-classification. The margins are not plain mulevven but polychrome MARBLED PAPER (battal ebru and gel-git ebru) in at minimum five distinct palette variants across the album's spreads. The plain mulevven appears only as a narrow inner strip between the outer marbled margin and the compound gold cedvel. The album thus has three simultaneous decorative paper layers: (1) battal/gel-git ebru as full outer margin ground; (2) plain mulevven as inner strip (teal and pink, alternating); (3) compound multi-band cetvel in gold and colors. This three-layer compound framing system is comparable to tiem_02481, tiem_02462, and hamidiye_00026 in the corpus, but the palette variation across spreads is more systematic and extensive than any of those comparanda. The donation label on the inside front cover (p002 left) reads: 'Merhum Raif Yelkenci hatırasına Sn. Nuri Arlasez Bağışı 270' — establishing that the album was donated by Nuri Arlasez in memory of Raif Yelkenci."

    "summary": "NA 00270 presents the most palette-diverse marbled programme documented in the Nuri Arlasez Koleksiyonu and among the most diverse in the entire project corpus. The decorative system operates on three simultaneous layers across every calligraphy spread: (1) OUTER MARGIN — full-width battal ebru (five distinct palette variants across examined pages) or gel-git ebru (p003, the opening calligraphy page); (2) INNER STRIP — narrow mülevven band in either teal/dark turquoise or pink/salmon, alternating across spreads; (3) COMPOUND CEDVEL — multi-band gold ruling framing the cream calligraphy panel, with the inner strip colour repeated in one of the cetvel bands. The red lacquer binding (p001) carries a large gold shamsa with rumi arabesque fill, salbek pendants, and thread border. The inside front cover doublure (p002 right) is battal ebru in pink/red with large green spots — a two-colour battal distinct from all interior palette variants. The five outer-margin palette variants are: (A) gel-git ebru, blue/green/red/pink/cream (p003); (B) battal, salmon/terracotta + blue (p005, p011); (C) battal, deep violet/purple + cream (p007); (D) battal, purple/mauve + amber/orange + white-grey (p009); (E) battal, deep lacivert/blue + red + amber/orange (p012). This systematic palette rotation across spreads is a deliberate compositional programme, not accidental variation — each new opening presents the student calligrapher with a fresh chromatic environment. The album is dated AH 1195 / 1781 CE and attributed to Muhammed el-Vasfî.",

The cetvel typically shows: one or two outer gold lines, a narrow color fill (matching the mulevven strip), then additional inner gold lines — producing a 3–4 line compound frame.",
      "description": "The compound cedvel structure is consistent and systematic across all examined calligraphy pages. On pages with teal inner strips (pp003, 005, 009), the cetvel uses gold + teal bands; on pages with pink inner strips (pp007, 012), the cetvel uses gold + pink bands. This color-matching between the mulevven inner strip and the cetvel infill band is a deliberate design choice, creating chromatic coherence within each spread while varying the overall palette across the album. The system is analogous to the compound cedvel programs documented in tiem_02481, hamidiye_00019, and pertevniyal_00049, but the explicit color-matching between strip and cetvel is a more systematic articulation of this convention than found elsewhere in the corpus at this scale."

The triage apparently confused the lacivert-dominant battal ebru on p007 with plain lacivert mulevven.

The closest parallels are tiem_02481 (two-scheme marbled system, pink left / blue-grey right) and hamidiye_00037 (2-layer mulevven system). However, NA 00270 applies the color variation across the album's temporal sequence (page-by-page) rather than across the album's spatial bilateral symmetry (left/right), making it a distinct compositional strategy."
