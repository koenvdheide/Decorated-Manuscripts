The decoration is attested by the YEK catalogue description ('gümüş yaldız serpmeli kâğıtlar') and corroborated by tonal evidence from viewer screenshots and IIIF imagery, though individual silver particles cannot be resolved at available image resolutions. A striking tonal asymmetry between facing pages in the IIIF view — one cream, one blue-grey — suggests differential density of silver application or differential tarnishing across the gathering. If confirmed, this is currently the only silver-sprinkled manuscript in the corpus. No gold cetvels, halkâr, or other framing decoration is visible. The script throughout is nastaʿlîq.",

This image reveals a striking tonal difference between the two visible pages: the left page appears to be standard cream/ivory paper with nastaʿlîq text, while the right page has a distinctly blue-grey cast. This blue-grey coloration could represent: (1) the tarnishing effect of dense silver sprinkling darkening the paper overall, (2) a colored (mülevven) paper stock used for the silver-sprinkled leaves, or (3) a different paper stock entirely within this mecmûʿa. The right page also shows a page number '10' in the upper margin. The text on both pages is in nastaʿlîq. The tonal difference between the two pages is the strongest visual evidence for silver sprinkling — if silver particles were densely applied and subsequently tarnished, they would produce exactly this kind of cool grey-blue tone shift compared to untreated paper."
