    "calligrapher_note": "Hasan Rıza (d. 1336/1920) was one of the most prolific and celebrated late Ottoman calligraphers of the Tanzimat–Meşrutiyet period. He studied under Sâmi Efendi (Mehmed Şefik, d. 1912), the dominant master of the period, and rose to prominence as a teacher and practitioner of nesih and sülüs scripts. He held positions at the Medresetü'l-Hattâtîn (School of Calligraphers, established 1914) and produced large numbers of calligraphic albums (muraqqaʿāt) as meşk (practice/teaching) specimens. His works are held in major Turkish collections including Süleymaniye, Türk ve İslam Eserleri Müzesi, and various private collections. The YEK catalogue records his name as 'Hasan Rıza' with the death date implied by the AH 1336 period. The ketebe inscriptions confirmed in the visual examination (p014 of yb_02788) and the consistent attribution in both matched volumes make the attribution firm.",

    "summary": "The decorative program of yb_02788 is organized around a systematically varied ebru (marbled paper) scheme, in which each calligraphy page receives a different ebru sheet — creating a chromatic sequence of maximum variety across the album. Three levels of decoration are present: (1) Binding exterior (p001): red leather cover with stamped gold lattice/trellis design — zerkâri, a salbek diamond grid with floral quadrilobed nodes at intersections and gold dots at centers, framed by multiple gold ruling lines. (2) Endpapers (p002): battal ebru (stone/spot marbled) in a red-coral, dark green, and cream-grey palette — classic large-droplet stone pattern. The same ebru is used for both inside cover doublures, confirming a single sheet was used for the endpaper program. (3) Calligraphy page margins (pp003–021): each of the examined calligraphy pages uses a DIFFERENT ebru paper for its outer margins, with the text panel window-mounted (vassale) into the ebru ground. Five distinct palettes and two ebru subtypes are confirmed across the seven examined pages: p003 (blue battal with white droplets), p008 (green-gold-brown gel-git / combed S-wave), p014 (red-green-grey battal), p018 (terracotta-brown battal with blue veins), p021 (purple-green battal with gold/yellow speckling). The remaining 14 unexamined pages likely contain further palettes. A consistent multi-line cedvel (ruled framing) system in gold, dark, and green lines frames each calligraphy panel throughout.",
    "distribution_notes": "Zerkâri binding: front and back covers (pp001, last). Battal ebru (red-green-grey): inside front and back cover doublures (p002 and final endpaper). Mixed battal ebru: outer margins of all calligraphy pages; subtypes and palettes vary per page (see folio_analyses for per-page detail).
