    "summary": "The decorative program of this Safavid manuscript is organized around the vassale (window-mounting) technique, by which text panels written on separate sheets of paper were cut and mounted into windows in elaborately decorated ebru (marbled) paper grounds. Two distinct ebru types are present: a full-page hatip ebru (imam's marbling, with large floral motifs in red, yellow, black, and cream) visible on what is likely a doublure or first flyleaf (p002), and a battal ebru (stone/spot marbling, in blue-grey, orange/salmon, and cream) serving as the ground sheet for the vassale-mounted text panels (p007). The text columns on p007 are additionally framed by gold cetvels (ruling lines), and the manuscript opens with an illuminated serlevha (headpiece) in blue and gold with hatayi (hatāyī / ختایی) motifs — a characteristically Safavid decorative vocabulary consistent with the Tabriz/Ardabil school under Shah Tahmasp. The binding is executed in the ruganî (lake / lacquer) technique with floral motifs, gold cetvels, floral and zencirek (chain-border) decoration, şemse (central medallion), and mıklep (flap), all of which are diagnostic of high-level Safavid bookbinding. This is one of the most complex and significant decorative programs in the corpus — an authentically Safavid luxury production that reached Istanbul via unknown intermediary channels and is now housed at Nuruosmaniye.",
    "distribution_notes": "The ebru ground papers cover the entire page area: the battal ebru is used as the support sheet into which text panels are window-mounted via the vassale technique, so the marbled paper is visible in the margins and between columns throughout the manuscript body. The hatip ebru at p002 functions as a separate decorative element — likely a flyleaf or doublure — rather than as a ground for mounted text.",
