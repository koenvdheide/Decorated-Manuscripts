The mismatched cover pair — a classic hatip ebru front with a different abstract-leaf marbled back — is a significant codicological observation: it may indicate (a) original production using two different ebru sheets from the same batch by convention, (b) later replacement of one cover following damage, or (c) deliberate aesthetic contrast. Physical examination of the binding structure (board attachment, paper lamination layers) would be required to distinguish repair from original design. The meşk (practice) nature of this album's calligraphic content distinguishes it from the presentation albums (tiem_02490, hamidiye_00010) and the master's album (tiem_02499): meşk albums were working objects, not gifts or status displays, which makes the hatip ebru cover relatively elaborate for the genre.

    "summary": "TIEM 02426 presents two distinct decorative elements. (1) Marbled covers: the front cover (p001) bears a spectacular hatip ebru (imam's marbled paper) with fully developed multi-petaled flower clusters — pink and orange/amber blooms on slender dark brown stems — set against a grey-green battal ebru ground. The hatip flowers are clearly formed with 3–5 rounded petals per cluster, classic silhouetted floral forms executed in the hatip technique. The back cover (p015) is also marbled but exhibits a different pattern: elongated, acanthus-like leaf forms with feathered edges in grey-green, salmon/peach, and dark tones — consistent either with a variant hatip ebru in a more abstract register, or with a different ebru subtype (gel-git or free-form battal). This mismatched cover pair is the most significant codicological finding in this record. (2) Cetvelli framing system: all 11 interior calligraphy pages (pp. 002–012) display a consistent 2–3 line cetvelli border (gold/olive outer line + dark ink inner lines), enclosing vassale-mounted calligraphy panels in a three-column layout. Small gold gül (rosette) roundels and floral corner-pieces appear at the column and panel junctions throughout. The interior margins are plain cream/nohudi — no zerefşân, no mulevven coloring, no zerendud — confirming a single-decoration-zone program: all decoration is concentrated in the covers. The inside back cover doublure (p014) shows a pink/salmon paper lining, which is a colored binding component rather than decorated text paper.",

Plain endpapers/flyleaf: p002 (inside front cover) is plain cream. p013 (back flyleaf) is plain cream. Covers themselves (pp. 001, 015) are the only sites of decorated paper in this album.",

Possible interpretations: (1) Original production using two different ebru sheets, one hatip and one gel-git/abstract — this would be unusual but not impossible; most Ottoman murakkaʿ albums use either matched pairs or plain leather covers. (2) Replacement of one cover: the back cover may have been replaced (rebound) after damage to the original matched hatip cover; or conversely the front cover may have been a later upgrade from a plain or damaged original. Physical examination of board attachment, sewing structure, and paper-board lamination layers is needed to distinguish these scenarios. The front cover (p001) hatip ebru is in relatively good condition; the back cover (p015) shows more handling wear (corner creasing, tonal shifts).

The stems are dark brown/sepia, slender and curved, emerging from the lower part of the cover and branching upward. Each stem carries one or two flower clusters at its tip. The composition is upward-growing from multiple stem origins across the cover width, creating a dense botanical surface.

The color palette (salmon/peach, grey-green, dark) overlaps partially with the front cover but the pattern structure is entirely different. This may be classified as: (a) a gel-git (combed) ebru in which the combing has elongated battal spots into leaf-like forms; (b) a variant hatip ebru in a more abstract, less structured register; or (c) a free-form battal ebru that has been manipulated to create flowing directional forms.
