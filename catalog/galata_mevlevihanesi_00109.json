    "summary": "RECLASSIFIED: The YEK catalogue records 'Ebru kagit' in the kagit_ozellikleri field, suggesting marbled paper. However, visual triage of the digitized pages during the non-TIEM murakkaa review identified no ebru on the writing surfaces; the sole examined screenshot (p003) shows large sülüs calligraphy on plain cream paper with ruled cetvels typical of a cetvelli murakkaʿ. The manuscript is accordingly catalogued as a cetvelli (ruled/framing-system) murakkaʿ per user decision. The 'Ebru kagit' description may refer to marbled paper used as a backing or doublure rather than the writing surface, or may represent a cataloguing error. This classification carries a moderate probability: visual coverage is limited to one page, and the correct context of the 'Ebru kagit' note has not been verified.",
