# The ketebe in Islamic manuscripts: a technical identification guide

**The ketebe (كتبه) is the calligrapher's or scribe's formal signature formula in Islamic manuscripts** — derived from the Arabic verb *kataba* ("he wrote"), specifically the phrase *katabahū* ("he wrote it"). In Ottoman Turkish scholarly usage this element is called *ketebe*, while the variant romanizations *tekerbe*, *tekebbe*, and *tekerre* appear in older or non-standard transliteration systems. The ketebe functions simultaneously as an attribution, a mark of professional authorization, and a devotional act. For manuscript identification purposes, it is the single most important element for establishing who copied a text, when, and where — making it the primary target for any digitized-manuscript reading system. This guide compiles the technical, visual, and formulaic information needed to locate, identify, and parse ketebe elements across Ottoman, Persian, and Timurid manuscript traditions.

## What a ketebe is and is not

The ketebe sits at the intersection of several distinct paratextual elements in Islamic manuscripts, and precision about boundaries matters for identification.

**Core definition.** The TDV İslâm Ansiklopedisi (Diyanet) defines *ketebe* concisely as "bir hattatın yazdığı yazının altına koyduğu imza" — the signature a calligrapher places beneath a work. The term itself is an Arabic noun derived from the root *k-t-b* (ك-ت-ب, "to write"). It functions in three ways: (1) as the Turkish technical term for the scribe's signature on a calligraphic piece; (2) as the scribal attribution formula in manuscript colophons, where the phrase *katabahū* plus the scribe's name records who copied the text; and (3) as the grammatical plural of *kātib* (كاتب, "scribe"), yielding *kataba/ketebe* meaning "scribes" collectively.

**The colophon relationship.** A colophon (*khatima*, خاتمة; Ottoman Turkish *ferâğ kaydı*) is the broader end-of-text inscription that may contain completion formulas, dating, location, patron information, pious prayers, and the ketebe. The ketebe is thus a **component within** the colophon — specifically the scribal attribution portion. In practice, the two terms overlap heavily. Turkish scholarship sometimes uses "ketebe kaydı" and "ferâğ kaydı" interchangeably, and Rosemarie Quiring-Zoche's foundational study "The Colophon in Arabic Manuscripts: A Phenomenon without a Name" (*Journal of Islamic Manuscripts* 4, 2013) confirmed that **no standard Arabic technical term for "colophon" existed during the manuscript age itself**. When a colophon exists, it almost always contains a ketebe element. When a ketebe appears standalone — as on a calligraphic panel (*levha*), album page (*kıt'a*), or practice sheet (*meşk*) — it functions independently.

**What a ketebe is not.** It must be distinguished from:

- **Ijāza (إجازة / icâzet):** A certificate of authorization. In the calligraphic tradition, the ijāza *grants* the right to use the ketebe — they are complementary, not identical. The ijāza contains a master's attestation of the student's competence and the transmission chain (*silsila*).
- **Ownership note (tamalluk, تملك):** Post-production inscriptions recording possession. These appear on title pages or flyleaves and use different vocabulary (*mallakahū*, *dakhala fī milk*).
- **Waqf note (وقف):** Legal endowment records documenting donation of the manuscript to an institution.
- **Reading certificate (samā', سماع):** Records that a text was read aloud in a teacher's presence — part of the knowledge-transmission (*isnād*) system, not the production system.
- **Collation marks (muqābala, مقابلة / balāgha, بلاغة):** Marks documenting textual comparison with other copies.

## Visual identification: where and how tekerbes appear on the page

The visual presentation of a ketebe varies significantly across traditions and manuscript types, but follows identifiable patterns that an image-recognition system can target.

**Primary location.** The ketebe appears at the **end of the text block**, on the final page of a manuscript or at the conclusion of a section in multi-text codices (*majmū'a*). In Persian and Ottoman poetry manuscripts, the text typically tapers into a **downward-pointing triangle** as the final lines shorten, and the ketebe sits at or just below the triangle's apex. The Leiden University MOUSE course describes this explicitly: "the angled lines tell you that something is coming up — the end of the text is coming up, so the lines have been written at angles both to announce the end and frame the colophon."

**On calligraphic specimens (*kıt'a*) and album pages (*muraqqa'*).** The scribe's name appears in the **lower-left triangle** — the triangular space created by diagonal verse arrangement. In Ottoman *hilye-i şerif* panels (descriptions of the Prophet), the ketebe appears in the lowest register, below the main text block.

**Script characteristics.** The ketebe is typically written in a **different script or smaller size** than the main text:

- In Ottoman manuscripts, the ketebe often switches to **rika' / icâzet hattı** (certificate script) — characterized by rounder letterforms with connected letters — while the main text is in *sülüs* or *nesih*.
- In Timurid manuscripts, the colophon may appear in **tawqī'** script while the body is in *naskh* or *nasta'liq*.
- In some Ottoman Qur'ans, scribes switched from *naskh* to **dīwānī** for the colophon.
- The script is frequently **unpointed** (lacking diacritical dots) and uses abbreviations, because the formulaic nature of the text made full pointing unnecessary for contemporary readers.

**Framing and decoration.** In luxury manuscripts, the ketebe area may be visually distinguished through:

- **Ruled lines** (*jadwal*) separating it from the main text
- **Red arabesques** or floral ornament framing the colophon block
- **Cloud bands** (*abr*) — contour bands following the rise and fall of letters, with gold, flowers, or crosshatching filling the interstitial spaces
- **Gold cartouches** — particularly in Timurid and Safavid luxury copies, where the colophon text may be **chrysographed** (written in gold ink)
- **Illuminated finispieces** — decorative panels around the end of the text, described in Déroche's *Islamic Codicology*
- On Ottoman *icâzetnâme* (diploma) documents, the master's attestation appears in distinct **cartouches** at the bottom, on differently colored paper, illuminated with gold

**Ink color.** Most commonly **black**, matching the main text. In luxury manuscripts: **gold** (*chrysography*); **red** for key phrases or dates (*rubrication*); occasionally **blue** for special emphasis (attested in Sultan Ali Mashhadi manuscripts). On colored album papers, **white** ink is used.

**How it differs from marginalia.** The ketebe is distinguished from marginal annotations by: (1) its position at the text's **end**, not in margins or interlinear spaces; (2) its **formulaic vocabulary** (see below); (3) its **triangular or tapered layout**; (4) its use of a **different script register** from glosses; and (5) scribal seals or stamps (*mühür*) that sometimes accompany it.

## The formulaic grammar of tekerbes

Ketebe formulas follow a remarkably stable grammatical structure across centuries and regions. An identification system can parse them by recognizing this structure: **[Completion formula] + [Praise of God] + [Blessings on Prophet] + [Attribution preposition] + [Self-deprecating epithet(s)] + [Scribe's name + patronymic + nisbah] + [Forgiveness prayer] + [Date] + [Place] + [Final abbreviation]**.

### Writing verbs (the core attribution)

The verb introducing the scribe's name is the ketebe's signature element:

| Arabic | Transliteration | Meaning | Notes |
|--------|----------------|---------|-------|
| كتبه | *katabahū* | "wrote it" | Most common; the source of the term *ketebe* |
| حرّره | *harrarahū* | "composed / set it down" | Implies careful rendering; common in later manuscripts |
| نسخه | *nasakahahū* | "transcribed / copied it" | Emphasizes faithful copying |
| مشقه | *mashaqahū* | "practiced / wrote it" | Distinctive Persian/Timurid usage; Sultan Ali Mashhadi used this to suggest a "work in progress" rather than a finished commission |
| علّقه | *'allaqahū* | "copied / wrote it down" | Attested in early manuscripts (e.g., Leiden Or 1070, 522 AH) |
| رقمه | *raqamahū* | "inscribed / penned it" | |
| سوّده | *sawwadahū* | "drafted it" | Literally "blackened it" — implies a rough draft |
| نقله | *naqqalahū* | "transferred / copied it" | From one exemplar to another |
| خطّه | *khattahū* | "penned it" | From *khatt*, "handwriting" |

The Leiden MOUSE course notes that "at the present state of research, it is unclear whether these words had really different connotations; they appear to be essentially synonymous," though *nasakha* tends toward faithful transcription, *sawwada* toward rough drafting, and *harrara* toward careful composition.

### Attribution prepositions

The scribe's name is introduced by one of these phrases:

- **على يد** (*'alā yad*) — "by the hand of" (most common)
- **بخطّ** (*bi-khaṭṭ*) — "by the writing/penmanship of"
- **على أنامل** (*'alā anāmil*) — "by the fingers of" (more elaborate)
- Direct verb + name: **كتبه [Name]** — "wrote it [Name]"

### Self-deprecating epithets

Scribes almost universally adopted **humility formulas** before their names. These range from single words to elaborate chains. They are one of the ketebe's most recognizable features:

**Simple epithets:** الفقير (*al-faqīr*, "the poor/needy one") · الحقير (*al-ḥaqīr*, "the contemptible one") · العبد (*al-'abd*, "the servant") · المذنب (*al-mudhnib*, "the sinful one") · الضعيف (*al-ḍa'īf*, "the weak one") · المسكين (*al-miskīn*, "the wretched one")

**Compound chains** — frequently stacked in manuscripts:

- **الفقير الحقير** (*al-faqīr al-ḥaqīr*) — "the poor, contemptible one" (Walters W.605: كتبه... على يد الفقير الحقير جمال الدين محمد الصدّيقي الاصفهاني)
- **العبد الضعيف المذنب** (*al-'abd al-ḍa'īf al-mudhnib*) — "the weak, sinful servant"
- **الفقير إلى الله تعالى** (*al-faqīr ilā Allāh ta'ālā*) — "the one needy of God the Exalted"
- **المحتاج إلى رحمة الله وغفرانه** (*al-muḥtāj ilā raḥmat Allāh wa-ghufrānih*) — "the one in need of God's mercy and forgiveness"

**Extreme superlative formulations:**

- **أفقر خلق الله وأحوجهم** (*afqar khalq Allāh wa-aḥwajihim*) — "the most wretched of God's creation and the most needy of them" (Walters W.591, Bursa, 918 AH)
- **أقلّ الأنام** (*aqall al-anām*) — "the least of creatures" (Walters W.608, 971 AH)
- **أضعف عباد الله** (*aḍ'af 'ibād Allāh*) — "the weakest of God's servants" (Walters W.630)

**Persian equivalents:** بنده (*bandah*, "servant") and كمترين (*kamtarīn*, "the most humble/least") appear in Persian-language colophons. **Chaghatay Turkish variants** include بو فقير (*bu faqīr*, "this poor man") and بو كمينه (*bu kamīna*, "this humble man").

### Completion formulas (opening the colophon)

These precede the ketebe and signal the text's end — the first visual cue for identifying the colophon area:

- **تمّ / تمّت** (*tamma / tammat*) — "it was completed"; abbreviated as the single letter **م** (*mīm*) at the colophon's very end
- **تمّ الكتاب** (*tamma al-kitāb*) — "the book was completed"
- **نجز الكتاب** (*najaza al-kitāb*) — "the book was brought to completion"
- **وقع الفراغ** (*waqa'a al-farāgh*) — "the completion occurred"
- **انتهى** (*intahā*) — "ended"; abbreviated as **ه** (*hā'*)

### Closing prayers

After the scribe's name, forgiveness formulas are nearly universal:

- **غفر الله ذنوبه** (*ghafara Allāh dhunūbahu*) — "may God forgive his sins"
- **غفر الله له ولوالديه ومشايخه وجميع المسلمين** — "may God forgive him, his parents, his teachers, and all Muslims"
- **عفا الله عنه** (*'afā Allāh 'anhu*) — "may God pardon him"
- **تجاوز الله عنه** (*tajāwaza Allāh 'anhu*) — "may God overlook him"

### Date and place formulas

Dates follow the pattern: **في + [time word] + [month] + من/في سنة + [number] + الهجرية** (*fī... min sanat... al-hijrīyah*). The month name may carry devotional adjectives (Ramadan is often المعظّم, "the magnified"). Dates are sometimes encoded in **abjad numerals** — alphabetic letters whose numerical values must be calculated.

Place names use: **ببلدة** (*bi-baldat*, "in the city of"), sometimes with protective prayers: **حفظها الله عن الآفات** ("may God protect it from calamities").

## Ottoman ketebe traditions: authorization, scripts, and forms

The Ottoman tradition transformed the ketebe from a simple attribution into **a mark of institutional authorization**. The 2019 MA thesis by Afra Soyuer (*Hat Sanatında İcâzetnâme ve Ketebe Geleneği*) establishes the key principle: "Osmanlı geleneğinde icazeti olmayan hattatın yazılarının altına imza atması usule aykırı sayılmıştır" — **in Ottoman tradition, signing without an icâzet was considered a violation of protocol**. The ketebe thus signified not just identity but legitimacy.

**The icâzet system.** A student (*talebe*) trained for years under a master (*hoca*) through the *meşk* method — copying exemplar lines hundreds of times, receiving corrections in red ink (*çıkartma*). Training progressed from individual letters (*müfredat*) through combined letterforms (*mürekkebat*) to complete compositions. When the master judged the student ready, the student wrote a demonstration piece — typically a *hadith* — and the master added an attestation granting permission to sign works independently. This *icâzetnâme* document contained the calligrapher's **chain of transmission** (*silsile*), linking them through an unbroken lineage to Şeyh Hamdullah (1429–1520) and ultimately to the Abbasid masters. The Library of Congress states explicitly that the ijāza gives "a student the authority to sign his own calligraphic works with expressions such as *katabahu* ('written by') and *hararahu* ('composed by')."

**Scripts in Ottoman ketebe contexts.** M. Uğur Derman documented that rika' script "gradually became the script reserved for the writing of calligraphers' certificates and signatures," earning the name **icâzet hattı** (certificate script). This is the single most important visual marker for Ottoman ketebe identification. The standard script allocation across Ottoman calligraphic forms:

- **Icâzetnâme bismillah:** sülüs (thuluth)
- **Student's demonstration text:** nesih (naskh)
- **Master's attestation and signature:** rika' / icâzet hattı
- **Hilye-i şerif panels:** sülüs + nesih, with ketebe in the lower register
- **Kıt'a (specimens):** paired sülüs + nesih; attribution in lower section
- **Levha (large panels):** celî sülüs or celî ta'liq
- **Muraqqa' (albums):** accordion-format collections of kıt'a, each with individual attributions

**The icâzetnâme as art object.** Uniquely Ottoman is the transformation of the diploma into a **standalone aesthetic work**: three or more strips of differently colored paper, illuminated with gold, floral motifs, and decorated *koltuks* (corner blocks), worthy of framing and display. A 1791 example by 'Ali Ra'if Efendi (Library of Congress) shows a hadith by the student with signed approvals by masters Mustafa al-Halimi and Husayn Hamid in lowermost cartouches, all on separate colored papers illuminated with gold.

**Distinctive Ottoman forms bearing ketebe:**

- **Hilye-i şerif:** Standardized by Hafız Osman (d. 1698); the ketebe appears in the panel's lowest section. This form is exclusively Ottoman — no Persian or Arab equivalent exists.
- **Meşk / karalama:** Practice sheets. The term *siyāh mashq* is the Persian equivalent. These may bear the student's name but not a formal ketebe (since the student lacks authorization).
- **Tekke levha:** Panels for Sufi lodges, often with mirror-work (*mütenâzır*) inscriptions.

## Persian and Timurid ketebe traditions: workshops, scripts, and distinctive practices

Persian manuscript culture differed from Ottoman in several structural ways that affect how ketebe elements appear.

**Workshop production and the kitābdār.** In the Timurid *kitābkhāna* (workshop-library), manuscript production was a **collaborative, supervised enterprise**. The *kitābdār* (librarian-director) oversaw the entire process without necessarily writing manuscripts himself — he directed scribes (*kātib/kuttāb*), illuminators (*mudhahhibs*), and painters (*naqqāsh*). The critical *ʿArza-dāsht* document (c. 1427), a progress report by Baysunghur's chief librarian Ja'far Tabrizi, provides unique evidence of this hierarchy. The ketebe in a Timurid manuscript therefore identifies the **physical copyist**, not necessarily the workshop director or patron.

**Herat school characteristics (c. 1420–1506).** Herat under the Timurids represents the apex of Persian manuscript production. Key features:

- **Sultan Ali Mashhadi (d. 1520)** signed in the **triangular colophon** and distinctively used the verb **مشقه** (*mashaqahū*, "he practiced it") instead of the standard كتبه (*katabahū*), deliberately suggesting a work in progress rather than a finished achievement. His colophons include the location formula **بدار السلطنية هرات** (*bi-Dār al-Sulṭanīyah Harāt*, "in the royal capital Herat").
- **Ahmad al-Rumi** (active under Baysunghur) wrote colophons "in large black tawqī' script" — demonstrating the Herat practice of using a distinct, larger script for colophons versus the body text.
- **Multi-script manuscripts** from Herat used *muḥaqqaq* for certain Qur'anic lines, *naskh* for body text, and *tawqī'* for colophons — three different scripts serving hierarchically distinct functions.

**Distinctive Persian practices.**

- **Mir Ali Heravi (d. c. 1544–55)** "typically signed his works with the diminutive epithet al-faqīr" and, remarkably, "allowed his pupils to sign their well-executed pieces with his name" — creating **major attribution challenges** that persist in modern cataloguing.
- **Mir Imad al-Hasani (d. 1615)** signed his name "four times as if he were perfecting the contours of his own autograph" on practice sheets (*siyāh mashq*), turning the signature itself into calligraphic art.
- Persian colophons frequently use **Arabic for formulaic elements** (completion phrases, prayers) even when the main text is entirely in Persian, reflecting Arabic's liturgical authority. Mixed Arabic-Persian colophons are extremely common.
- **Shi'i markers** appear from the Safavid period onward — blessings on Ali and the *Ahl al-Bayt* (the Prophet's family) in the *salawāt* section distinguish Safavid-era colophons from Sunni Ottoman ones.
- The Persian term **انجامه** (*anjāmah*, "ending note") and **قيد شد** (*qayd shud*, "was recorded") serve as equivalents to the Arabic colophon terminology.

**Shiraz school versus Herat.** Shiraz developed a distinctive *naskh* characterized by "long tails on *nūn*, *sīn*, and *yā'* which usually embrace the following word." Shiraz was a major book-production center before Timur's consolidation, and artists and calligraphers moved between the two cities, creating hybrid styles.

## Where tekerbes appear across manuscript types

**Single-text manuscripts.** The ketebe appears on the **final page**, typically within the triangular tapering of the last lines. In codices with multiple texts (*majmū'a*), each individual work may have its own colophon with ketebe.

**Album pages (*muraqqa'*).** In calligraphic albums, the attribution appears in the **lower-left triangle** of the page — the triangular space created by diagonal verse arrangement. Ottoman *muraqqa'* are accordion-format; each leaf carries its own attribution.

**Multi-scribe manuscripts.** Luxury manuscripts produced in royal workshops were collaborative. The *Haft Awrang* of Jami (c. 1556–65) was written by both Shah Mahmud al-Nishapuri and Malik Daylami, who signed as *mashq-i Malik* ("composition of Malik"). Album folios may contain specimens by multiple calligraphers — for example, Sultan Mahmud, Shah Muhammad, and Sultan Muhammad Nur on a single folio, with Sultan Muhammad Nur explicitly stating he "penned this example by imitating the style of Mawlānā Sultan Ali al-Mashhadi."

**Flyleaves and added pages.** Later owners, librarians, and institutional cataloguers sometimes added attributions to flyleaves or margins near existing colophons — these are **secondary attributions**, not original ketebe, and use different vocabulary (typically ownership or authentication language).

**Calligraphic exercises (*meşk*).** Practice sheets do not bear a formal ketebe in the Ottoman system, since the student has not yet received authorization. The master's corrections in red ink are the identifying marks on these sheets.

---

## Why tekerbes are difficult to read

Several factors make ketebe elements among the most challenging parts of a digitized manuscript to parse computationally.

**Abbreviated and unpointed writing.** Because colophon formulas were so standardized, scribes routinely omitted diacritical dots and used abbreviations. The letter **م** (*mīm*) alone at the end of a colophon abbreviates تمّ (*tamma*, "completed"). The letter **ه** (*hā'*) abbreviates انتهى (*intahā*, "ended"). **Abjad-encoded dates** require calculating the numerical values of Arabic letters — for example, غلو = 1000 + 30 + 6 = 1036 AH.

**Physical damage.** Colophons sit at manuscript ends, the most vulnerable position for physical deterioration — water damage, insect damage, leaf loss, and binding damage disproportionately affect final pages. Faded ink compounds the problem.

**Script complexity.** The deliberate use of different (often more informal) scripts for the ketebe, combined with the cramped space of a triangular ending, produces writing that is denser and less legible than the main text.

**Copied colophons.** Later scribes sometimes reproduced the colophon of their exemplar alongside their own, creating **double colophons** — one from the original manuscript and one from the current copy. Distinguishing the two requires careful analysis of formulaic language and internal consistency. The Leiden MOUSE course demonstrates this with a manuscript "preserving both the colophon of the original manuscript, and then writes its own colophon particular to this copy."

**Ghost attributions.** Mir Ali Heravi's practice of allowing students to sign with his name means that many "Mir Ali" attributions are actually by anonymous students — a problem that cannot be resolved through text alone and requires paleographic analysis.

**Overlapping annotations.** Later ownership notes (*tamalluk*), authentication marks, and library stamps may be written directly adjacent to or overlapping the original ketebe, making boundary detection difficult. The Mughal emperor Jahangir inscribed ownership notes directly beside Sultan Ali Mashhadi's triangular colophon.

## A complete annotated colophon: structural anatomy

The following real example (Walters W.591, Bursa, 918 AH / 1512 CE) illustrates every structural component:

> تم والحمد لله أولا وآخرا والصلوة والسلام على رسوله محمد وآله وصحبه باطنا وطاهرًا على أنامل أفقر خلق الله وأحوجهم محمد بن پير أحمد الشهير بارغون الشيرازي عفى الله عنهما في آخر شعبان لسنة ثمان عشر وتسعمائة الهجرية ببلدة الطيبة البورسة حفظها الله عن الآفات م

Parsing this element by element: **[تمّ]** completion → **[والحمد لله أولا وآخرا]** praise of God → **[والصلوة والسلام على رسوله محمد وآله وصحبه]** blessings on Prophet → **[على أنامل]** attribution preposition ("by the fingers of") → **[أفقر خلق الله وأحوجهم]** superlative self-deprecation → **[محمد بن پير أحمد الشهير بارغون الشيرازي]** full name with patronymic and *nisbah* → **[عفى الله عنهما]** forgiveness prayer (dual form covering scribe and father) → **[في آخر شعبان لسنة ثمان عشر وتسعمائة الهجرية]** date → **[ببلدة الطيبة البورسة حفظها الله عن الآفات]** place with protective prayer → **[م]** final abbreviation for *tamma*.

---

## Conclusion

The ketebe is structurally formulaic but visually variable — a paradox that both helps and hinders automated identification. Its **formulaic grammar** provides strong textual anchors: completion verbs (*tamma*, *najaza*), writing verbs (*katabahū*, *harrarahū*), self-deprecating epithets (*al-faqīr*, *al-'abd al-ḍa'īf*), and forgiveness prayers (*ghafara Allāh*) form a predictable sequence that a parsing system can target. Its **visual signatures** — triangular text tapering, script changes, end-of-text positioning, decorative framing — provide spatial cues for localization on the page. Yet the tradition-specific variations (Ottoman rika' signatures versus Timurid tawqī' colophons versus Persian nasta'liq triangles), combined with physical damage patterns, unpointed script, and the ghost-attribution problem, mean that no single identification heuristic suffices. The most robust approach would layer spatial detection (end-of-text triangular layout), script-change detection (shift to smaller or different hand), and formulaic-phrase recognition (the Arabic verb-epithet-name-prayer sequence) to reliably locate and parse these elements across the full range of Ottoman, Persian, and Timurid manuscript traditions.
