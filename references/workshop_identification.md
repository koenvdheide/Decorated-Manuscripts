# Visual forensics of Islamic manuscript workshops

**Workshop attribution of decorated Islamic manuscripts rests on a convergence of visual style, material fingerprints, and codicological evidence — no single marker is sufficient alone.** Each major tradition left diagnostic traces in its palette, compositions, scripts, paper, and binding that skilled analysis can decode. This report deepens identification markers for four principal traditions (Timurid, Safavid, Mamluk, Ottoman), then documents ten additional traditions from Ilkhanid Iraq to Southeast Asian Qur'an illumination, and concludes with the scientific and bibliographic toolkit for attribution. The evidence base has expanded significantly since 2018, particularly through pigment fingerprinting studies and digital comparative resources that now make systematic cross-workshop analysis feasible.

## Timurid workshops: from Baysunghur's atelier to Bihzad's revolution

### Baysunghur's kitābkhāna at Herat (c. 1420–1433)

The single most important document for understanding any Islamic manuscript workshop is the **arzadasht (progress report) of c. 1427**, a folio detailing Baysunghur's atelier operations: over 30 manuscripts in simultaneous production, specialist teams of calligraphers, painters, illuminators, and binders under centralized direction. Wheeler Thackston's translations (1989, 2001) and Shiva Mihan's 2018 Cambridge dissertation provide the fullest analysis.

Diagnostic visual features of Baysunghur-era production include a **classical palette emphasizing turquoise, amethyst, and lapis lazuli** with extensive gold leaf. Compositions are balanced and architectonic, with figures arranged in multiple planes by vertical stacking. Page formats are unusually large (the Shahnameh of Baysunghur measures ~38 × 26 cm), and the double-page illuminated frontispiece — with blue-and-gold interlacing cartouches around gilded lobed medallions — became a workshop hallmark. The characteristic nastaliq of **Ja'far al-Baysunghuri (Ja'far Tabrizi)** shows increased proportion relative to Baghdadi nastaliq, decreased roundness of letters, and a shifted center of gravity in standing mediates and bowls. David Roxburgh has demonstrated that this workshop systematically copied Jalayirid prototypes, making "studied emulation" itself a diagnostic trait — the Kalila wa Dimna (Topkapı R.1022) directly copies paintings from Topkapı H.362.

### Later Timurid Herat under Sultan Husayn Bayqara (c. 1469–1506)

The shift from Baysunghur's workshop to the late Timurid atelier is marked by a move **from epic formalism to lyrical intricacy**. Lamia Balafrej's *The Making of the Artist in Late Timurid Painting* (2019) characterizes this as an "aesthetics of intricacy" fostered by the literary majlis culture of Mir Ali-Shir Nava'i's circle.

Kamal al-Din **Bihzad** (head of the Herat academy from 1486; only 32 securely attributed paintings, executed 1486–1495) transformed the tradition through several diagnostic innovations. His compositions use **geometry and architecture as structural frameworks** rather than formulaic layouts — the famous "Seduction of Yusuf" from the Cairo Bustan (1488) uses an entire building as a compositional device. Colors are modulated rather than flatly applied. Figures show unprecedented **psychological individualization** with expressive faces and hands, naturalistic poses, and genre detail. Spatially, Bihzad's paintings spread laterally and vertically, reducing text space and incorporating extra-textual figures. His **tahrir (line work)** is exceptionally smooth with dense minute detail. Signatures hide in architectural inscriptions. The Cairo Bustan contains the only four surviving genuine Bihzad signatures. Sultan Ali Mashhadi replaced Ja'far as the leading nastaliq calligrapher.

### Samarkand versus Herat

Timurid Samarkand under Ulugh Beg (d. 1449) was primarily a **scientific rather than literary center** — the observatory produced the Zij-e Ulugh Beg, and manuscript production favored scientific and historical texts in naskh. Herat, from Shah Rukh's relocation onward, dominated illustrated literary manuscripts in refined nastaliq. Samarkand paper (famous since the 8th century) differs from the distinctive "brown Herati paper" of Herat workshops. The sophisticated illuminated literary manuscripts that define "Timurid painting" — Shahnameh, Khamseh, divan copies — are overwhelmingly Herati products. When a Timurid manuscript contains scientific content in naskh on Samarkand-type paper, Samarkand provenance becomes more probable; a literary text in refined nastaliq with the turquoise-amethyst-lapis palette and elaborate frontispiece program points to Herat.

## Safavid workshops: three capitals, three distinct identities

### Tabriz under Shah Tahmasp (c. 1525–1555)

The diagnostic masterwork is the **Tahmasp Shahnameh (Houghton Shahnameh)**: 759 folios, 258 miniatures at approximately 48 × 32 cm — an unprecedented scale. Each painting has an independently conceived format requiring constant collaboration between scribes, painters, and marginators. The palette is brilliantly polychromatic; pigment analysis confirms dominant **ultramarine (not azurite)** in Tabriz royal manuscripts, with complex pigment mixing more elaborate than in earlier or later periods. Compositions extend beyond the text frame, with figures, animals, and rocks deliberately spilling into margins. Gold skies are a Sultan Muhammad trademark. The distinctive **jadval (ruling lines)** incorporate a bright green band alongside blue and gold, outlined in black.

The Tabriz style synthesizes two predecessors: the Western Iranian **Turkmen/Aq Qoyunlu idiom** (dynamic verve, violent colors, concealed grotesques, illogical perspectives) and the Eastern Iranian **Timurid/Herati manner** (balanced harmony under Bihzad's influence from c. 1522). Figures wear the **taj-i Haydari** — the Qizilbash headgear with 12 folds representing the 12 Shi'i imams — a political-diagnostic marker absent in Timurid or pre-Safavid manuscripts.

### Qazvin period (c. 1555–1598)

When the capital moved to Qazvin and Shah Tahmasp issued edicts of repentance, the royal kitabkhana was largely dismantled. Most master artists fled to Mughal or Ottoman courts; only **Aga Mirak** remained. The diagnostic manuscript of this period is the **Haft Awrang of Jami** (Freer Gallery, 1556–65), commissioned by Prince Ibrahim Mirza — produced across three cities (Mashhad, Qazvin, Herat) by five calligraphers and multiple painters, a fundamentally decentralized production model contrasting with Tabriz.

Qazvin production differs from Tabriz in several ways: a **muted palette with more brown and purple tertiary colors** replacing Tabriz's brilliant primaries; elongated figures with smaller rounded heads; emergence of single-page paintings and tinted drawings for albums (muraqqa'); thinner gold application; and experimental compositions lacking the monumental unified character of Tabriz royal work.

### Isfahan period (c. 1598 onwards)

Under Shah Abbas I, fully illustrated manuscripts declined dramatically in favor of **single-page album paintings (muraqqa')**. **Riza Abbasi** (directed the kitabkhana 1597–1635) defined Isfahan through a fluid calligraphic line depicting single or paired figures against lightly drawn backgrounds. His career shows three diagnostic phases: early works in primary colors with virtuoso technique; a mid-career crisis period (c. 1603–10) with darker, earthier colors and unconventional subjects; and a late return to court with coarser line and satirical subjects. European influences ("Farangi-Sazi" style) introduced perspective, shading, and atmospheric effects — artists like Muhammad Zaman painted in explicitly Europeanizing modes. **Lacquer bookbinding** became a major art form, first signed by Riza Abbasi himself.

### Shiraz commercial production versus court workshops

Commercial Shiraz manuscripts are identifiable by **small formats, repetitive stock compositions (poncifs), round-faced figures with long noses, and less complex pigment mixing**. Although ultramarine appears (confirmed by analysis), Shiraz workshops sometimes used azurite as a cheaper alternative. After 1501, the taj headgear appears, reflecting Safavid political influence. Most Shiraz manuscripts are unsigned, unlike increasingly signed court productions. Lâle Uluç's 2006 study traces the evolution of the Shiraz trade manuscript from the illuminator Ruzbihan's early work through Qasim b. Ali's adoption of Tabriz court elements.

### Named Safavid masters as diagnostic keys

**Sultan Muhammad** (active c. 1495–1540): Only two signed works survive. His hallmarks are **hidden faces and creatures ("grotesques") embedded in polychromatic rock formations**, gold skies, figures spilling beyond frames, and the transition of blue rocks into green. His masterwork *The Court of Gayumars* (Aga Khan Museum) features scores of concealed human and animal faces in rocks.

**Aga Mirak**: No signed works survive. Attributions rest on inscriptions in the British Museum Khamsa (1539–43). A noted portraitist and colorist, he specialized in **janvar-sazi** — painting exotic Far Eastern creatures (dragon, phoenix, qilin). Early works show tautly composed landscapes with few large-scale figures.

**Dust Muhammad**: Painter who authored the preface to the Bahram Mirza Album (1544), the earliest Safavid account of Persian painting history — this text is itself a primary source for attribution of Tahmasp Shahnameh painters.

## Mamluk workshops: geometric mastery and monumental Qur'ans

### Bahri period (c. 1250–1382)

Early Mamluk Qur'an illumination reaches its apogee in **double-page frontispieces (carpet pages)** featuring intricate geometric strapwork with interlocking polygons alternating in gold and blue. The **Baybars al-Jashnagir Qur'an** (British Library, 1304–06) — a seven-volume set by calligrapher Muhammad ibn al-Wahid and illuminators Muhammad ibn Mubadir and Aydughdi ibn 'Abd Allah al-Badri — exemplifies the Bahri style: arabesques completely enclosing calligraphy, gold rosettes marking verse endings, and regularly spaced gold dots filling blank spaces. The master gilder Sandal (active 1304–15) was responsible for the gold decoration.

Diagnostic patterns include **10- and 12-pointed star medallions** with gold-and-white outlines forming trellis patterns of overlapping polygons. Surah headings appear in **white Kufic within gilt panels on striking blue ground** — a highly distinctive feature. The primary script for monumental Bahri Qur'ans is **muhaqqaq**, bold and angular with extended horizontal strokes, typically at 12 lines per page. David James's *Qur'ans of the Mamluks* (1988) remains the fundamental catalogue.

### Burji period (c. 1382–1517)

The shift to the Burji period brings several diagnostic changes: the body script transitions from muhaqqaq to refined cursive **rayhani**; gold architectural structures containing liturgical instructions (e.g., the word "prostration" in blue Kufic) appear as visual aids; layouts move from enclosed Bahri formats toward an **impression of infinite space**; and **30-part Qur'ans** become standard (reflecting the practice of daily Ramadan recitation). The palette broadens with increased red, green, and polychrome elements, while geometric interlace grows more complex and arabesques more fluid.

### Cairo versus Damascus

Distinguishing Cairo from Damascus production remains difficult without colophon evidence — many manuscripts are cautiously catalogued as "Egypt or Syria." The most reliable architectural parallel is that **Egyptian muqarnas mouldings have angular points** while Syrian ones have **rounded profiles**, a distinction that may extend to manuscript ornamentation. Cairo, as capital, was the primary center of royal patronage; Damascus served as a secondary center producing manuscripts of somewhat different character.

## Ottoman workshops: the nakkaşhane and its signature vocabularies

### The nakkaşhane-i hümayun

The Imperial Design Workshop, organized under the **Ehl-i Hiref** (Professionals of the Imperial Household) from the late 15th century, operated with a complex hierarchy documented from 1525 Ottoman Archives. A **başnakkaş** (chief painter) managed projects; specialized divisions included musavvir nakkaş (miniaturists), müzehhip (illuminators), tarrah (layout designers), calligraphers, and bookbinders. Because artists were salaried palace staff working collaboratively, they rarely signed work — the **stylistic consistency** of nakkaşhane output is itself a diagnostic marker. Pin-pricking technique (iğne delme) for pattern transfer ensures precise bilateral symmetry, and manuscripts bear the sultan's tughra or dedicatory inscription.

### Period diagnostics

Under **Mehmed II** (1451–81), the founder **Baba Nakkaş** (of Uzbek descent) established the workshop. Italian influences entered through painters like Gentile Bellini (1479–80); works are described as "crude and provincial" due to limited examples.

**Bayezid II** (1481–1512) represents a transition: calligrapher **Sheikh Hamdullah** established the canonical Ottoman calligraphic style; hatayi patterns first appear on tughra beyzes (oval elements).

The **golden age under Süleyman** (1520–66) introduced three overlapping decorative vocabularies that became Ottoman signatures: the **saz style** (developed by Şahkulu from Tabriz — long feathery sawtoothed leaves, composite blossoms, dragons and phoenixes in Chinese-influenced compositions); **hatayi** (symmetrical peonies and buds in stages of bloom); and **rumi patterns** (spiraling intertwining stems with stylized leaves, descended from Seljuk Anatolia). The **çintamani** motif — three circles above two wavy lines — signifies power and sultanate. The dominant palette is **gold and navy blue** with vivid red and green accents.

### Named Ottoman illuminators

**Karamemi** (mid–late 16th c.), Şahkulu's pupil, introduced **naturalistic flower decoration (şükufe)** featuring the four "quarter flowers" — **tulips, roses, carnations, and hyacinths** — that became Turkey's most recognizable ornamental vocabulary. His designs sit on symmetrical circular spirals with saz-style dagger leaves and double-tahrir hatayis.

**Nakkaş Osman** (active c. 1560–90s), chief miniaturist under Selim II and Murad III, established the **standard Ottoman sultan portrait formula**: rulers depicted kneeling or sitting cross-legged, holding handkerchief and book or flower, shown in profile. His *Surname-i Hümayun* (1582) contains 250 double-page illustrations of Murad III's circumcision festival.

## Beyond the four traditions: ten additional workshop lineages

### Ilkhanid Tabriz and Jalayirid Baghdad (c. 1256–1410)

The **Great Mongol Shahnameh** (c. 1330s) is the diagnostic masterwork of Ilkhanid Tabriz: monumental format (~57.6 × 39.7 cm), **heavy Chinese influence** in gnarled trees, wave-like rocks, curling cloud strips, dragon motifs, and lotus designs. Figures possess monumental scale with barely contained energy. Compositions extend beyond picture frames, frequently showing figures from behind. The **Jami' al-Tawarikh** manuscripts from Rashid al-Din's scriptorium at Rab'-i Rashidi (employing 300+ workers) show Chinese pen-drawing influence with limited palette and standardized Mongol countenances.

Jalayirid Baghdad (c. 1340–1410) marks a diagnostic shift from **epic intensity to lyrical contemplation**. Formats shrink to intimate dimensions. Figures become "puppetlike" and elegant against rich gold backgrounds. The **black pen technique (qalam siyahi)** — compositions in black ink with gray washes and touches of blue, brown, and gold — reaches its height in the Freer Divan of Sultan Ahmad Jalayir (c. 1400). Junayd Naqqash's signed paintings in the British Library Khamseh of Khvaju Kirmani (1396) are the firmest attribution point. The Jalayirid-to-Timurid transition shows strong continuity through forced artist migration after Timur's conquests and systematic copying of Jalayirid prototypes by Baysunghur's atelier.

### Mughal India: three emperors, three paradigms

**Akbar's kitābkhāna** (c. 1570–1600) is identifiable through collaborative production marked by **red-ink marginal inscriptions** naming the composition master (tarh), colorist ('amal), and portraitist. The fusion of Safavid and Indian elements produced dynamic, crowded multi-figure narratives with warm saturated colors, Indian flora, and increasingly naturalistic figures. The Hamzanama (c. 1562–77) — approximately 1,400 illustrations on cotton, not paper — is uniquely massive.

**Jahangir's period** (c. 1605–27) shifted to album painting with heightened naturalism. Diagnostic features include **strict profile portraiture with psychological depth**, allegorical "dream" paintings combining Flemish symbolism with Islamic imagery, and magnificent **gold floral margins on indigo-dyed paper**. Ustad Mansur specialized in natural history subjects with scientific precision; Abu'l Hasan created imperial allegorical compositions.

**Shah Jahan's period** (c. 1628–58) formalized production into instruments of imperial ideology: the **durbar formula** (emperor on jharokha balcony with large golden nimbus, courtiers ranked hierarchically below) becomes standard. The Windsor Padshahnama programmatically integrates "Persianate abstract linearity" against "Europeanizing illusionism" within single images.

Mughal illumination is distinguishable from Persian prototypes in that **"seemingly flat circles of Timurid or Safavid tradition become swelling globes"** in 'unwans and shamsas — a distinctive three-dimensionality.

### Deccani workshops: Bijapur and Golconda

Deccani manuscripts are distinguishable from Mughal by their **brilliant, jewel-like palette** (deep earth tones with gold-embellished pastel pink, purple, green), "mystic and fantastic overtones" contrasting with Mughal realism, elongated figure types derived from Vijayanagar wall paintings, and South Indian dress elements. **Bijapur** (Adil Shahi) productions feature surreal, visionary compositions with Persian-Turkish decorative motifs; the Nujum al-Ulum (1570, Chester Beatty Library) with 876 miniatures is the earliest dated Deccani manuscript. **Golconda** (Qutb Shahi) shows stronger Central Asian/Iranian orientation, strict symmetry, and distinctive use of purple and occasionally blue-toned animals.

### Bukhara: the conservative inheritor

Shaybanid Bukhara (c. 1500–1598) painting is diagnostic for its **deliberately retardataire quality** — emulating 15th-century Timurid Herat conventions decades after they had been superseded at Safavid courts. Barbara Schmitz identified three coexisting trends: variations on Bihzad's Herat style (carried by Shaykhzada), derivative Safavid court style, and an emerging indigenous Bukharan manner. Later works under Abdullah Khan show **stereotyped backgrounds with low hills, reduced figure counts (one to three large figures), and thinly applied pigments**. Jaimee Comstock-Skipp's 2023 work identifies "militant manuscripts" that insert Shaybanid leaders into Chinggisid genealogies — a thematic diagnostic marker.

### Seljuk Anatolia: the single surviving masterwork

The **Varka and Gulshah** (Topkapı H.841, c. 1250), with 71 paintings by Abd al-Mu'min al-Khuyi, is the earliest surviving illustrated Persian literary manuscript and virtually the only Seljuk Anatolian illustrated manuscript. Diagnostic features include horizontal-format paintings, "thickset figures with large round heads" reflecting Turkic physiognomic conventions, accurately depicted Seljuk military equipment, and flat non-perspectival compositions. The **rumi motif** — Seljuk stylization of animal wings and limbs — passed directly into Ottoman decorative vocabulary.

### Qajar Iran: brass substitutes for gold

Qajar manuscripts (19th c.) continue Safavid traditions with key differences: **large, prominent headpieces (sarlavh)** with regular rhythmic patterns; **brass alloy (copper-zinc) widely substituted for genuine gold leaf** — detectable through SEM-EDS analysis and a strong diagnostic marker distinguishing Qajar from earlier work. Chrome green (a post-1810s pigment) is another chronological indicator. European influences pervade: gradations of color, shading, atmospheric perspective. Under Nasir al-Din Shah, photography and lithography gradually supplanted manuscript illumination.

### Maghribi and Andalusian traditions: a script family apart

North African manuscripts are immediately recognizable through the **Maghribi script family** — written with a pointed-tip pen producing lines of even thickness (contrasting with Eastern thick-thin variation), with reversed notation of fa' and qaf. The **multicolored vocalization system** is highly diagnostic: **mauve/purple diacritics, yellow dots for diacritical points, green dots above initial alifs**. Parchment remained the preferred Qur'an medium far later than elsewhere, and manuscripts feature square text-block formats.

Andalusian production adds further markers: **zigzag marks along the central fold of bifolia** definitively indicate al-Andalus provenance. The Pink Qur'an (13th c., dispersed across the Met, Minneapolis, Qatar, and Getty) exemplifies Andalusian innovation — distinctive tinted pink paper from Játiva (Valencia) with bold Maghribi script and blue abjad verse numbers in gold discs. After the fall of Granada (1492), Andalusi and broader Maghribi scripts merged, making post-1492 distinction extremely difficult.

### Sub-Saharan African traditions: Timbuktu, Harar, and the Swahili coast

West African manuscripts (Timbuktu and environs) are identified through **unique binding — pages unattached to covers, placed loose between protective boards** — a practice found nowhere else in the Islamic world. Scripts include the distinctive **Suqi ("market") script** with noticeably square letterforms. The 2016 University of Leuven study used micro-XRF and multispectral imaging on Timbuktu manuscripts, while HMML has digitized over 150,000 manuscripts from evacuated Timbuktu libraries.

**Harari** (Ethiopian) manuscripts show a remarkable fusion of influences: a bihari-influenced naskh with thin diacritical marks and thick wedge-like sublinear extensions, combined with Mamluk-style frontispiece formats and concentric marginal medallions — sitting at the intersection of Indian, Yemeni, and Egyptian traditions. Sara Fani's 2017 *Islamic Africa* study and Sana Mirza's work at NYU are defining these diagnostic features.

The **Swahili coast** (particularly Pate Island, Lamu Archipelago) produced illuminated Qur'ans on Northern Italian paper with blind-stamped leather covers and locally developed Arabic scripts. Zulfikar Hirji's 2023 *Journal of Islamic Manuscripts* study documents a corpus with Solomon's knot (Arèwá) motifs as division markers.

### Southeast Asian traditions: a world of local innovation

Annabel Teh Gallop's scholarship at the British Library has established the definitive diagnostic framework for Southeast Asian Islamic manuscripts. **Acehnese** (Sumatran) Qur'ans are identified by their rigid structural formula — extended vertical borders sloping inward at top and bottom, arches on three outer sides, tendril-like "wings," and a **plaited rope motif**. The palette is always **red, yellow, black, and "reserved white" (unpainted paper) — gold is never used**, a key distinguishing feature. Text frames follow a red-black-red-black ruled pattern.

**Javanese** manuscripts are diagnostic through **dluwang** (bark cloth from paper mulberry, technically not paper) and the **banji (swastika) motif** in black and blue — absent elsewhere in Southeast Asian Qur'ans and reflecting Chinese cultural influence. Javanese illumination shows extraordinary variety with no single "school."

**Malay** (Terengganu/Kelantan/Patani) manuscripts feature the richest illumination in Southeast Asia, with text frames in black-thick yellow-black-black-red lines (gold replacing yellow in the finest copies). **Patani** manuscripts show diagnostic black endpapers of Thai manufacture and an "interlocking wave" motif.

The **Sulawesi diaspora style** is recognized by strongly geometric compositions of rectangles, circles, and triangles in a bold palette of **black, brown, red, and ochre**. **Mindanao** (Philippines) Qur'ans are unique for **wooden outer covers** — found nowhere else in Southeast Asian Islamic manuscripts.

## Scientific toolkit for workshop attribution

### Pigment analysis as provenance fingerprint

The landmark study is **Knipe et al. 2018 (Heritage Science 6:55)**, conducted at Harvard's Straus Center: over 50 works analyzed using XRF, Raman spectroscopy, FTIR, SEM-EDX, and hyperspectral imaging. The core finding is a **stable base palette across regions and periods (13th–17th century)**: lazurite (lapis lazuli), vermilion, orpiment, red lead, lead white, and carbon black. Regional and temporal variation appears in secondary pigments — Indian yellow in certain works, complex green mixtures (indigo + orpiment), and copper greens (malachite, atacamite). **Chronological markers** include Prussian blue (terminus post quem ~1720), emerald green, barium sulfate as filler (19th century), and chrome green (post-1810s).

XRF is the primary non-destructive technique, identifying elemental signatures (Hg for vermilion, Pb for lead pigments, Cu for copper greens, Au for gold). Raman spectroscopy provides molecular-level identification at ~1 μm resolution. FORS enables completely non-invasive analysis of organic dyes. Burgio, Clark & Muralha's 2008 V&A study confirmed that pigment ranges remained stable in 16th–17th century manuscripts and expanded in the 18th century with synthetic introductions.

Subsequent studies include Koochakzaei et al. (2022) on a Qajar Qur'an finding brass substitutes for gold; Vieira, Nabais, and Melo (2019) identifying kermes extract in 15th-century Timbuktu parchments of Andalusian origin; and Holakooei's work associating kaolinite/alunite with iron-bearing pigments at Nishapur as local provenance indicators.

### Paper, ink, and codicological markers

Paper analysis yields regional signatures: **Samarkand paper** uses cotton fibers with visible fiber clumps; Persian 16th–17th century papers are predominantly flax from rags; Syro-Egyptian papers show characteristic chain lines in groups of two or three; European imports (post-15th century) have evenly spaced lines with watermarks — often crescent moons for Islamic-market exports. **Sizing agents** serve as chronological markers: Barkeshli et al. found cucumber-seed sizing in 8 of 9 examined 16th–17th century Persian manuscripts, with starch sizing becoming predominant only from the 18th century onward. The presence or absence of watermarks is itself diagnostic — Islamic-made papers generally lack them.

Ink analysis by XRF distinguishes **carbon ink** (no metallic signature; stable, non-corrosive) from **iron gall ink** (strong Fe peaks; corrosive). Both coexisted, with carbon-based black ink predominating in early Islamic Qur'ans. Gold application analysis by SEM-EDS distinguishes pure gold, gold-silver alloys, copper substitutes, and brass — the latter diagnostic of Qajar or other late/provincial production.

The **misṭara (ruling board)** is among the most powerful workshop-attribution tools: each board creates a unique pattern of line spacings, and multiple manuscripts ruled with the same board can be linked to the same workshop. François Déroche's *Islamic Codicology* (2006) provides the methodology. Islamic manuscripts typically use **quinions** (five-bifolium gatherings of 10 leaves) as the standard quire structure, distinguishing them from Western quaternions. Binding structures show regional variation — the distinctive Islamic **envelope flap** extending from the back cover, combined with regional endband styles and board construction, aids localization.

## Reference works and digital resources for attribution

### Essential catalogues and scholarship

The foundational catalogue for Mamluk work is David James's *Qur'ans of the Mamluks* (1988). For Persian painting: Dickson & Welch's *The Houghton Shahnameh* (1981) and Canby's *The Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp* (2014). For Mughal: Beach's *The Imperial Image* (1981) and Welch et al.'s *The Emperors' Album* (1987). For Ottoman: Necipoğlu's *The Topkapi Scroll* (1995). For calligraphy: Blair's *Islamic Calligraphy* (2006). For codicology: Déroche's *Islamic Codicology* (2006) and Gacek's *Arabic Manuscripts: A Vademecum for Readers* (2009). For paper: Bloom's *Paper Before Print* (2001). For painting techniques: Porter's *Painters, Paintings and Books* (2003). For albums: Roxburgh's *The Persian Album, 1400–1600* (2005). For Maghribi traditions: Bongianino's *The Manuscript Tradition of the Islamic West* (2022). For Southeast Asia: Gallop's studies in *Archipel* (2004) and *Indonesia and the Malay World* (2005).

### Digital comparative resources

The most significant recent developments are in digital access. The **Chester Beatty Library** offers online collections with Creative Commons images. The **Walters Art Museum** hosts a virtual Islamic manuscripts gallery with 58 complete downloadable manuscripts. **Princeton's Digital Library of Islamic Manuscripts** holds ~9,500 bound manuscripts. **Fihrist** provides a British union catalogue for Arabic-script manuscripts across Oxford, Cambridge, SOAS, and the British Library. **HMML's Reading Room** offers access to over 150,000 digitized Timbuktu manuscripts and 800 Ethiopian Islamic manuscripts. The **'Ilm Foundation** database indexes over 2 million Islamic manuscript records from 3,000 libraries across 65 countries. The **DREAMSEA Project** at HMML focuses specifically on Southeast Asian manuscripts.

### Recent scholarship and emerging methods (2020–2025)

Key recent publications include Rettig & Mirza's *The Word Illuminated: Form and Function of Qur'anic Manuscripts from the 7th to 17th Centuries* (Smithsonian, 2023), and Bongianino's *The Manuscript Tradition of the Islamic West* (Edinburgh, 2022). Ben Azzouna & Roger-Puyo's 2016 study in *Journal of Islamic Manuscripts* directly addresses workshop identification through Rashid al-Din's Majmu'a Rashidiyya. Comstock-Skipp's 2023 *Journal of Art Historiography* article reframes Shaybanid manuscripts as political instruments.

**Computational connoisseurship** represents the frontier: deep transfer learning (ResNet50 + SVM) has achieved 98% accuracy for Western painting attribution (Ugail et al. 2023), and vision transformers show promise, but **computational approaches specifically for Islamic manuscripts remain nascent** — representing a significant opportunity. OpenITI's Kraken engine provides state-of-the-art Arabic-script OCR for manuscript digitization.

## Conclusion: convergent evidence as the only reliable method

No single diagnostic marker — whether palette, script, binding structure, or pigment analysis — suffices for workshop attribution. The most reliable attributions emerge from the convergence of multiple independent lines of evidence: visual style (composition, figure types, landscape conventions, decorative vocabulary), material analysis (pigment fingerprints, paper fibers, sizing agents, ink composition), codicological structure (quire format, ruling patterns, page proportions), and contextual evidence (colophons, patronage records, seal impressions). The field has been transformed since 2018 by non-destructive analytical techniques — particularly portable XRF and Raman spectroscopy — that enable pigment fingerprinting without sampling, and by the proliferation of high-resolution digital collections that make systematic cross-workshop comparison feasible for the first time. The most promising immediate opportunities lie in applying computational pattern recognition to ruling-board analysis (where matching misṭara patterns across manuscripts could link otherwise unassociated works to single workshops) and in building comprehensive pigment databases organized by region and period. The traditions documented here — from Baysunghur's Herat to the wooden-covered Qur'ans of Mindanao — represent a continuum of artistic production spanning three continents and eight centuries, united by shared scripts and texts but distinguished by locally diagnostic solutions to the arts of the book.
