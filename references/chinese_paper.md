# Chinese paper in Islamic manuscripts: luxury imports that transformed Persian book arts

Gold-sprinkled, dyed, and painted papers from Ming China rank among the most extraordinary materials found in Islamic manuscripts. **At least 15 specific manuscripts — overwhelmingly from fifteenth-century Timurid Iran — have been confirmed as containing Chinese paper** through fiber analysis, motif reconstruction, and codicological study. The leading scholar on this topic, Ilse Sturkenboom (LMU Munich), heads the ERC-funded GLOBAL DECO PAPER project, which is producing the first systematic scientific analysis of this material. Chinese decorated paper arrived in Herat through documented diplomatic gifts from the Ming Yongle Emperor to Shah Rukh in 1412, 1417, and 1419, and its extraordinary cost — **20 dinars per page, accounting for 28% of a Shahnameh's total production cost** — made it the single most expensive component in luxury manuscript production. The phenomenon is distinct from the broader, centuries-long history of papermaking technology transfer along the Silk Road: while papermaking knowledge reached the Islamic world by the mid-eighth century, the importation of finished Chinese luxury paper for Persian codices was a concentrated fifteenth-century phenomenon tied to Timurid–Ming relations.

## From Talas to Timurid courts: how Chinese paper entered the Islamic world

The traditional narrative centers on the **Battle of Talas (751 CE)**, where Abbasid forces defeated Tang China near the Talas River in present-day Kyrgyzstan. The eleventh-century Persian historian al-Tha'alibi records that captured Chinese papermakers introduced their craft to Samarkand. However, Jonathan Bloom's *Paper Before Print* (2001) — winner of the College Art Association's Morey Prize — argues this account is more legend than history. Archaeological evidence shows paper was already circulating in Central Asia decades earlier: the Mount Mugh archive near Panjakent contains Sogdian documents on paper left by a lord captured by the Arabs in **722 CE**, nearly thirty years before Talas. The Sogdian Ancient Letters, written on Chinese paper around 313 CE and found near Dunhuang, demonstrate that paper traveled 2,000 miles along trade routes as early as the fourth century. Bloom contends that Sogdian merchants, who dominated east–west trade from the fourth through eighth centuries, gradually propagated papermaking techniques through commercial contact rather than through a single dramatic event. The Persian word for paper, *kāghaẕ*, derives from a Sogdian loan word, supporting this interpretation.

What is not disputed is that Samarkand became the first great Islamic papermaking center, renowned for quality paper exported across the caliphate. By 793–795, Baghdad had its own paper mills, and by the ninth century paper was replacing papyrus in Egypt. A critical innovation in Islamic lands was the shift from Chinese bast fibers (mulberry, bamboo, hemp) to **rag-based production using cotton, linen, and hemp waste** — a fundamental material difference that persists as the primary diagnostic marker separating Chinese from Islamic papers.

The **Mongol Empire** (peak ca. 1250–1350) created unprecedented conditions for renewed Chinese paper imports. The Pax Mongolica secured overland routes, established the *yam* postal relay system, and standardized tariffs. The Ilkhanate in Persia maintained close ties with the Yuan dynasty: in 1294, Ilkhanid ruler Gaykhatu even attempted to introduce Chinese-style paper currency (*chao*) in Tabriz, complete with Chinese characters. The Timurid dynasty (1370–1507) continued these transcontinental connections through formal embassies. Persian sources record that a Chinese embassy arrived in Herat in **April 1417** bearing "falcons, brocades, velvets, silks, porcelain vessels and Chinese paper." The artist Ghiyas al-Din Naqqash traveled with a return Timurid embassy to Ming China in 1419–1422, keeping a detailed diary. These diplomatic exchanges delivered the colored, gold-decorated papers that would transform Persian manuscript production for the next century.

## Fifteen manuscripts confirmed on Chinese paper

The following manuscripts represent the core identified corpus. Almost all date to the fifteenth century and originate from Timurid or Timurid-adjacent courts. Sturkenboom's research established the identifications through fiber analysis, gold-motif reconstruction, and codicological comparison.

**Dated manuscripts:**

| Shelfmark | Contents | Date | Origin | Key Chinese paper features |
|-----------|----------|------|--------|---------------------------|
| Bodleian Library, MS. Pers. E.26 | Kulliyat of Sa'di | 1437 | Herat | Colored folios with gold gourd-vine, landscape, and pavilion motifs. Fiber analysis confirmed paper mulberry, ramie, hemp. Lead content detected by XRF |
| TIEM Istanbul, Inv. 1992 | Five works of 'Attar | c. 1438 | Herat (for Shah Rukh) | Multi-colored sheets with gold designs. Sturkenboom reconstructed original Chinese sheets of c. 35 × 106 cm, cut into folios |
| Chester Beatty, Per 127 | Anthology of Persian poetry | 1430s–1440s | Shiraz | 7 Chinese paper folios among 171 of Islamic paper. Olive-green coloring with gold-painted vine and fruit motifs |
| British Library, Add.7759 | Divan of Hafiz | October 1451 | Probably Herat | 31 pages with Chinese ornamentation: bamboos, pomegranates, Chinese palaces amid mountains and lakes. Colors: orange, pink, blue, yellow-green, grey, purple |
| British Library, Add.16561 | Anthology of 12 poets | October 1468 | Shamakhi, Azerbaijan | Highly polished Ming decorated paper dyed pink, mauve, yellow-green with large gold flecks. Exhibited at British Museum "Ming" exhibition (2014) |
| NYPL, Spencer Persian 41 | Makhzan al-asrar of Nizami | August 1478 | Timurid Iran | Priscilla Soucek's seminal 1988 study demonstrated original long Chinese sheets were painted before being cut — designs appear at right angles to text |
| Süleymaniye Library, Ayasofya 4334 | Anthology (Nava'i, Jami, others) | 1497–98 | Probably Herat | Colored decorated paper with Chinese-style gold motifs. Calligraphy by Sultan Muhammad Khandan |

**Undated manuscripts (fifteenth century):**

| Shelfmark | Contents | Key features |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| TIEM Istanbul, Inv. 41 | Qur'an | Grey folios (22.7 × 18.0 cm) with gold gourd-vine, landscape, and bird designs. Six bifolios cut from a single Chinese sheet |
| Detroit Institute of Arts, Acc. 30.232 | Qur'an folios | Microscopic coating analysis confirmed Chinese paper characteristics |
| Sarikhani Collection (private) | Qur'an | **Most scientifically analyzed example.** Fiber analysis confirmed paper mulberry (*Broussonetia papyrifera*), ramie, hemp, cotton. Light-blue, dark-blue, and dark-pink folios with gold mountainous landscapes and gourd plants |
| Tareq Rajab Museum, Kuwait | Qur'an | Gourd-vine and landscape-with-pavilion designs matching other manuscripts in the corpus |
| Christie's (auctioned) | Qur'an | Dark-purple and light-orange folios with gold pomegranate designs and gold flecking |
| BnF, Suppl. persan 1798 | — | c. 1450, Chinese paper |
| BnF, Suppl. persan 1425 | — | c. 1480, Chinese paper |

A notable finding is that **the Great Mongol Shahnameh** (Demotte Shahnameh, c. 1330s, Ilkhanid Tabriz), while deeply influenced by Chinese artistic styles, is not documented as being on imported Chinese paper — its Chinese connections are stylistic rather than material. The Chinese paper phenomenon in Islamic manuscripts is overwhelmingly a fifteenth-century Timurid phenomenon.

A separate category includes **29 Islamic manuscripts from Xinjiang** in Leiden University Library (from Kashgar, Yarkand, Yengi Hisar, and Turpan), studied by Karin Scheper and Arnoud Vrolijk in their landmark 2011 article "Made in China." These manuscripts display hybrid Chinese–Islamic features: Chinese paper types, butterfly binding structures, and stab-stitching alongside Islamic textual traditions.

## How codicologists identify Chinese paper

Distinguishing Chinese paper from Islamic-made paper relies on converging lines of evidence — fiber composition, sheet format, surface characteristics, and decoration — confirmed through a battery of scientific techniques.

**Fiber analysis remains the primary diagnostic method.** Chinese papers contain paper mulberry (*Broussonetia papyrifera*), ramie, bamboo, and hemp — bast fibers fundamentally different from the cotton, linen, and hemp rags used in Islamic papermaking. The standard protocol involves micro-sampling (~0.2g), boiling to separate fibers, and staining with **Herzberg stain** (zinc-chlorine-iodide) or **Graff C stain**, then examining under polarized light microscopy. Paper mulberry is identifiable by its transparent primary wall membrane that stains violet to bluish-purple — considered the single most diagnostic feature. Ramie shows ribbon-like fibers with wide lumens and longitudinal stratifications. Bamboo reveals silicified epidermis under SEM-EDX imaging. Islamic rag fibers (flax, cotton) stain brilliant purplish pink to vivid red-purple with Herzberg stain, making the distinction clear.

**Sheet format provides crucial evidence.** Chinese decorated papers originated as long horizontal sheets — approximately 35 × 106 cm in Sturkenboom's reconstructions — designed as Chinese stationery or scroll paper. When incorporated into Persian codices, these sheets were cut into smaller folios. A telltale indicator is that **gold-painted designs appear at right angles to the Persian text**, because the decorative compositions were oriented for Chinese horizontal reading but the sheets were rotated and cut for vertical Persian codex format. Sturkenboom traced identical designs across separate manuscripts, demonstrating that folios in different codices were cut from the same original Chinese sheets.

**Surface treatment and sizing differ systematically.** Islamic papers are distinguished by intensive burnishing — diagonal parallel lines from polishing with glass or agate tools create the extraordinary smoothness required for *nasta'liq* calligraphy. Chinese papers generally lack this treatment; indeed, Persian scribes had to apply additional starch sizing before writing with reed pens on Chinese paper, as the original Chinese sizing (designed for soft brushes) was insufficient for Persian inks. The absence of watermarks also distinguishes Chinese papers, since bamboo moulds cannot accommodate wire designs.

Advanced analytical techniques include **beta-radiography** (the gold standard for recording paper structure, using carbon-14-embedded polymethyl methacrylate plates to produce high-contrast images of mould patterns without interference from text), **SEM-EDX** (for detecting silicified plant epidermis and analyzing gold-decoration composition), **XRF** (non-destructive elemental analysis — David Howell used this at the Bodleian to characterize gold in MS. Pers. E.26), **ATR-FTIR** (for identifying sizing agents and fillers), **Raman spectroscopy** (for pigment identification), and the emerging technique of **phytolith analysis** (extracting and identifying silicon-rich plant structures diagnostic of rice, bamboo, or wheat straw through SEM-EDX after dry ashing).

## The specific Chinese paper types found in Islamic manuscripts

The Chinese papers documented in Persian manuscripts fall into several categories, though the gold-decorated type dominates the identified corpus.

**Gold-sprinkled and painted decorated paper** constitutes the overwhelming majority of identified examples. These are long sheets dyed on both sides in vivid colors — pink, mauve, olive green, light blue, orange, grey, dark purple, yellow-green — and decorated with fine gold sprinkles, large gold flecks, and painted gold compositions depicting Chinese landscapes with mountains, pavilions, and pine trees; flora including bamboo, pomegranates, and gourd vines; and birds in flowering trees. Fiber analysis of this paper type has confirmed paper mulberry, ramie, hemp, and cotton — a mixed-fiber composition characteristic of Chinese production. This paper was manufactured as Chinese stationery for painting and calligraphy (comparable to surviving Chinese examples such as Wu Wei's 1459–1509 paintings on stationery paper in the Palace Museum, Beijing) and was repurposed for Persian codices.

**Paper mulberry (bast) paper** is the foundational Chinese paper type, made from inner bark of *Broussonetia papyrifera*. It appears in Silk Road manuscripts from Dunhuang and in the Xinjiang Islamic manuscripts studied by Scheper and Vrolijk. Its long, strong fibers and characteristic transparent primary wall membrane make it the most reliably identifiable Chinese fiber.

**Hemp and ramie papers** appear in early Chinese papers and as components of the decorated papers. Hemp was identified alongside ramie in the Sarikhani Qur'an samples. These fibers are sometimes difficult to distinguish from each other when damaged by aging and processing.

**Bamboo paper** (*zhuzhi*), common in Chinese printing from the Song dynasty onward, is identifiable through SEM-EDX detection of silicified bamboo epidermis and characteristic bilobate and saddle-shaped phytoliths. It is less commonly documented in Islamic manuscripts specifically but is part of the broader Chinese paper tradition that intersected with the Islamic world.

**Xuan paper**, made from blue sandalwood bark (*Pteroceltis tatarinowii*) and rice straw originating from Anhui Province, represents another Chinese paper tradition. A 2024 study developed NIR spectroscopy for non-destructive characterization of Xuan paper, though its specific presence in Islamic manuscripts has not been systematically studied.

## Scholarly foundations and the current state of research

The study of Chinese paper in Islamic manuscripts rests on foundational works by several scholars, with an active and rapidly evolving research frontier.

**Jonathan Bloom**'s *Paper Before Print: The History and Impact of Paper in the Islamic World* (Yale, 2001) provides the essential historical framework, documenting how Persian calligraphers prized Chinese (*khitai*) paper and how the bibliographer Ibn al-Nadim in the tenth century recorded meeting a collector who had Chinese paper transported thousands of miles. **François Déroche**'s *Islamic Codicology* (Al-Furqan, 2005/2006) remains the standard reference for material analysis of Arabic-script manuscripts. **Helen Loveday**'s *Islamic Paper: A Study of the Ancient Craft* (Archetype, 2001) established the first systematic typology based on analysis of over 1,000 dated samples. **Karin Scheper**'s *The Technique of Islamic Bookbinding* (Brill, 2015; 2nd ed. 2018) provides the first monograph on Islamic bookbinding structure and won the De la Court Prize from the Royal Netherlands Academy.

The breakthrough work on Chinese decorated paper specifically belongs to **Priscilla Soucek**, whose 1988 *Ars Orientalis* study of NYPL Spencer Persian 41 first demonstrated that Chinese sheets were painted before being cut for Persian codices, and to **Sheila Blair**, whose "Color and Gold" (*Muqarnas* 17, 2000) surveyed decorated papers across later Islamic traditions. **Ilse Sturkenboom** has since become the primary authority, publishing the first systematic scientific analysis of Chinese paper in Persianate manuscripts and leading the ERC-funded **GLOBAL DECO PAPER project** (€1.5 million Starting Grant, Project ID 101078434) at LMU Munich, which investigates decorated paper across early-modern China, Central Asia, Iran, India, and the Ottoman Empire through interdisciplinary natural-scientific and art-historical methods. **Yusen Yu**'s "Gold Sprinkled: Chinese Paper and Persian Book Arts during the Fifteenth Century" (University of Chicago Press, 2021) analyzes the corpus from both Chinese and Persian perspectives. **Agnieszka Helman-Ważny** (University of Warsaw/CSMC Hamburg) has conducted the most extensive fiber analysis of Silk Road papers, studying 182 Chinese manuscripts from the British Library, BnF, St. Petersburg, and Berlin collections.

Key journals publishing on this topic include *Heritage Science* (which published major technical studies by Mahgoub et al. in 2016 and Knipe et al. in 2018), *Journal of Islamic Manuscripts* (Brill), *Muqarnas*, *Ars Orientalis* (Freer/Sackler and University of Michigan), *Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society*, and conservation journals including *JAIC*, *Restaurator*, and *Journal of Paper Conservation*.

## Where the manuscripts are held and who is studying them

The identified manuscripts on Chinese paper are distributed across major collections worldwide. The **Museum of Turkish and Islamic Art (TIEM), Istanbul** holds multiple Qur'ans and literary manuscripts on Chinese paper. The **British Library** holds Add.7759 and Add.16561, both exhibited at the British Museum's 2014 "Ming: 50 years that changed China" exhibition. The **Bodleian Library** holds MS. Pers. E.26, studied under its Bahari Visiting Fellowship program. The **Chester Beatty** holds Per 127 along with over 4,400 Islamic manuscripts total. The **Topkapi Palace Library** holds albums H. 2153 and H. 2160 containing Timurid-era materials including Chinese woodblock prints. The **NYPL** holds Spencer Persian 41, subject of Soucek's pioneering study.

Active institutional research programs include the **Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures (CSMC)** at the University of Hamburg, operating as the Cluster of Excellence "Understanding Written Artefacts," with a mobile laboratory for manuscript analysis. The **Straus Center for Conservation** at Harvard Art Museums published the most comprehensive technical analysis of Islamic manuscript materials (Knipe et al., 2018), examining over 50 works. The **Heritage Science Laboratory** at the University of Ljubljana maintains a collection of 260 Islamic paper samples. The **CNRS/IRHT** in France conducts fundamental manuscript research and maintains the multilingual *Codicologia* glossary. The **Islamic Manuscript Association** organizes professional courses (including "Traditions of Papermaking in the Islamic World" at the British Library in 2015) and publishes conservation bibliographies.

The **British Library Qatar Foundation Partnership**, now in Phase 4, represents the largest ongoing Islamic manuscript digitization and conservation program, though its focus is broader than Chinese paper specifically.

## Conclusion

Chinese paper in Islamic manuscripts is not a diffuse, centuries-spanning phenomenon but rather a sharply defined episode in material culture: **the importation of gold-decorated Ming Chinese paper to Timurid Iran during roughly 1410–1500**, facilitated by diplomatic embassies and Silk Road luxury trade. The corpus of confirmed manuscripts numbers at least fifteen, concentrated in collections from Istanbul to Dublin, and fiber analysis consistently reveals paper mulberry, ramie, and hemp — fibers absent from Islamic rag-based papermaking traditions. The field is being transformed by Sturkenboom's ERC GLOBAL DECO PAPER project, which is applying systematic scientific analysis to collections across the Middle East and Asia for the first time. Several important questions remain open: the precise mechanism by which Chinese stationery paper was selected and shipped as diplomatic gifts, the full extent of the corpus (Sturkenboom has identified additional unpublished examples), and the material relationship between Chinese decorated papers and the marbled, gold-sprinkled papers that Islamic artisans subsequently developed through local innovation. What is clear is that these imported Chinese sheets — colored, gilded, and painted with landscapes and flowering vines — were among the most valuable materials in the Islamic luxury book trade, valued at a cost that exceeded even the scribes' wages.
