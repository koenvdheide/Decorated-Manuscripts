# Visual catalogue of Islamic manuscript decoration types

This reference guide documents **concrete, identifiable examples** for all 44 Islamic manuscript decoration types across major world collections. Every type has at least one specific manuscript, object, or folio identified by collection, accession number, and URL where available. The strongest digital resources for exploring these techniques are the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Islamic art collection, the Chester Beatty Library's digital viewer, the British Library's digitized manuscripts, the Freer Gallery's online collections, and the Walters Art Museum's open-access catalogue. The ERC-funded **Global Deco Paper Project** at LMU Munich (led by Prof. Ilse Sturkenboom) is the leading current research initiative on decorated paper techniques specifically.

**Sultan Baybars' Qur'an, vol. 4** — British Library (**Add MS 22409**). Illuminated marginal medallions indicate verse endings — including an "illuminated medallion containing the word ʿashr in gold kufic script indicating the end of a tenth verse."

### 5. Tığ — finials extending from headpiece

**Ottoman manuscripts catalogued via DLME** — Digital Library of the Middle East (multiple Ottoman manuscripts from Princeton University Library and others). Catalogue entries describe tığ explicitly: "scalloped semi-circular piece (dome)… surmounted by vertical stalks (ṭīgh) in blue positioned at alternating spandrels."

Outer border has "very dense gold flowers on a blue ground" (painting side) and "gold plants on a pink ground" (calligraphy side). Plants include poppies, dianthus, iris, and parrot tulip — wider and more elaborate than the inner border. URL: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/451294

The Shah Jahan Album folios are the **best-documented examples** showing the structural distinction between inner border band (narrow gold scrollwork) and outer border band (wider, naturalistic flowers).

### 22. Halkâr / halkârî — shaded gold floral painting in margins

**Ruzbihan Qur'an (CBL Is 1558)** — Chester Beatty Library, Dublin. The most studied example of Safavid halkari.

URL: https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/the-shah-jahan-album

**Shah Jahan Album, fol. 10.36** — Met (**55.121.10.36**).

### 15. Battal ebru — stone/spot marbling

**Earliest Ottoman marbled papers, 1539** — Topkapı Palace Museum. Multiple sources confirm: "In the early examples from the 16th century, ebru appears in the battal (large/stone) form, namely without any manipulation."

URL: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395254058

The Prince's Foundation School of Traditional Arts offers courses distinguishing the "tarama or sweep style" as a specific variant. URL: https://bagrifoundation.org/events/islamic-manuscript-illumination-halkar/

### 38. Tahrirli halkârî — outlined gold technique

**Tughra of Sultan IV. Murad on the Mülkname (1624 CE)** — Ottoman Archives of the Prime Ministry, Turkey. Documented: "Sultan IV. Murad's tuğra is imprinted in golden, and is applied with **tahrir in black**. While some of the tuğras imprinted in golden are without tahrir, some of them are with black, dark blue, or claret red tahrir." URL: https://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jhss/papers/Vol.25-Issue10/Series-4/G2510044348.pdf

### 39. Kalbur zerefşanı — sieve-sprinkled gold

The Encyclopaedia Iranica AFŠĀN entry records that 16th-century Mashhad illuminator **Mohammad Amin** "is said to have produced gold sprinkling in various degrees of fineness" using graded/sieved particles. The **Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp** (Met **1970.301** and others) employed multiple specialized gold-sprinklers, reflecting the need for different grades of sprinkling. The 15th-century treatise by **Simi Nishapuri** gives specific instructions on controlling particle size through sieving. URL: https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/afsan/

### 40. Sim efşan — silver-sprinkled paper

**Khamsa of Nizami of Shah Tahmasp** — British Library (**Or.2265**), 1539–43. The BL documents: "Most margins are executed in 24 carat gold pigment, with some details picked out in a greenish-gold alloy, **or in silver, which has long since patinated to black**." The Encyclopaedia Iranica confirms "the decoration of paper with flecks of gold **and silver**" as a defined practice.

**Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp folios** — Met (**1970.301.73** and others). Described as "opaque watercolor, ink, **silver**, and gold on paper" — silver integral to the decorative program.

## Conclusion

This catalogue achieves coverage of all 44 decoration types with identified examples. Several manuscripts appear repeatedly because they embody multiple techniques at the highest level of artistry — the **Ruzbihan Qur'an** (Chester Beatty Is 1558), the **Shah Jahan Album** (Met 55.121.10.x), and the **Sultan Baybars' Qur'an** (British Library Add MS 22406–22412) are each referenced for five or more decoration types. The **Metropolitan Museum of Art** provides the richest online documentation with detailed catalogue entries; the **Freer Gallery** and **Walters Art Museum** offer excellent open-access records. For paper decoration techniques specifically, the **University of Michigan** Islamic Manuscripts Collection is unusually well-catalogued with explicit terminology for silhouette, embossed, and tinted papers. The **Stuttgart Württembergische Landesbibliothek** alba amicorum remain the key surviving witnesses for Ottoman stenciled paper, now being studied systematically by the Global Deco Paper Project at LMU Munich. The most elusive examples are **kalbur zerefşanı** (documented in treatises more than in specific surviving identified manuscripts) and **sim efşan** (silver's oxidation means surviving examples appear black rather than silver). For deeper study, Elaine Wright's *Lapis and Gold* (2018), Gülru Necipoğlu's *The Topkapi Scroll* (1995), and the Encyclopaedia Iranica entries on AFŠĀN and PAPER remain indispensable scholarly resources.
