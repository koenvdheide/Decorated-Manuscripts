# Beyond the 44: additional decoration types in Islamic manuscripts

**Islamic manuscript decoration encompasses far more than the standard 44 types typically surveyed.** This report documents **25 primary decoration categories plus over 15 additional sub-types and motif-level elements** found across Ottoman, Safavid, Mamluk, Timurid, Mughal, and Maghribi traditions. Each entry provides precise terminology (Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, Persian), visual identification guidance, manuscript placement, and tradition-specific variants. The terminology for Islamic manuscript decoration is not standardized across scholarly traditions — Ottoman Turkish vocabulary (codified in the TDV İslâm Ansiklopedisi) is the most systematically developed nomenclature, while English-language scholarship often mixes Persian, Arabic, and Western codicological terms.

## 1. Carpet pages: the illuminated gateway before the text

**Terminology:** English: *carpet page*, *double frontispiece*. Ottoman Turkish: *tam sayfa tezhibi* (full-page illumination). Arabic: *ṣafḥa mudhahhabah* (صفحة مذهبة). Persian: *sar-lawḥ-i tamāmiyya*, *tazhīb-i tamām ṣafḥa*. Some scholars object to "carpet page" as demeaning to sacred text; David James prefers "double frontispiece."

**Visual identification:** Full-page illumination filling an entire folio with **non-figurative geometric and/or vegetal ornamentation**, typically presented as a double-page spread with mirror-image symmetry across the gutter. Central compositions often based on stars (8-pointed *khatam*, hexagons, octagons) surrounded by concentric frames of increasing complexity. **No continuous body text appears** — this is the critical distinction from serlevha/ʿunwān pages, which contain readable Qur'anic text below the headpiece. Brief Qur'anic inscriptions (particularly Q 56:76–80 or Q 85:21–22) may appear in small rectangular panels at top and bottom.

**Position:** At the very beginning of a volume, before text starts. In multi-volume Qur'ans, at the beginning of each volume. A matching *finispiece* sometimes closes the volume.

**Tradition-specific variants:**

- **Mamluk** (13th–15th c.): Extensive geometric patterns with gold filigree, polychrome palette (gold, lapis blue, red, green). The **Baybars Qur'an** (1304–06, British Library) across 7 volumes introduced Qur'anic quotations into carpet pages. Central star patterns radiate through nested rectangular frames.
- **Ilkhanid** (13th–14th c.): Complex layered surfaces connecting manuscript illumination to architectural decoration (cf. Mausoleum of Uljaytu). The **Sultan Uljaytu Qur'an** (1310/11, BL Or 4945) shows the Mongol-era style. Around 1335, the shamsa medallion began displacing geometric carpet pages.
- **Timurid** (15th c.): Cloud-chain (*bulut*) motifs replaced heavier geometric patterns. Increased vegetal arabesques. Late 14th-century Shiraz (Muzaffarid dynasty) introduced deep blue pigments and baroque-edged cartouches.
- **Safavid and later:** The shamsa largely replaced the geometric carpet page as the standard frontispiece.

**Subtypes:** Pure geometric (no text); carpet page with inscription panels (Mamluk convention); juz' divider carpet pages; finispiece carpet pages matching the frontispiece.

## 2. Verse markers and text division markers: the hierarchical system of mushaf gülleri

Ottoman terminology groups all Qur'anic marginal markers under **mushaf gülleri** (مصحف گللری, "Qur'an rosettes"). These form a strict hierarchy from smallest to largest.

### a. Durak / verse-ending rosettes (gül-i fâsıla)

**Terminology:** Ottoman: **durak** (دوراق, "stop/pause"). Arabic: **ʿalāmat al-āya** (علامة الآية) or **fāṣila** (فاصله). Persian: *gül-i fāṣila*.

**Visual identification:** Small ornamental rosettes placed at the end of each verse within the text. In early Kufic Qur'ans (9th–10th c.), simple red-green dot rosettes with central gold dot. In Mamluk manuscripts, **six-petalled gold rosettes**. In Ottoman manuscripts, gold and polychrome illuminated rosettes with blue and red dots. In Safavid Qur'ans, gold discs or florets. In Maghribi Qur'ans, ornate medallion-shaped markers.

**Documented Ottoman subtypes by form:** *Helezonî durak* (spiral-form); *şeşhâne durak* (six-compartment/hexagonal); *pençhâne durak* (five-compartment); *mücevher/geçme durak* (jewel/interlocking); *müzehhep durak* (gilded).

### b. Khams markers (hamse gülü / خمسه گلى)

Decorative medallions in the page margin at every **5th verse**. Originally teardrop-shaped (*damla biçiminde*), later pear-shaped (*armudî*) marginal medallions. Some contain the word "hamse" in the center; others are purely decorative.

### c. ʿAshr markers (aşere gülü / عشره گلى)

Marginal medallions at every **10th verse**. Originally marked by the letter ʿayn (ع), the first letter of ʿashr. Circular (*daire*) illuminated forms replaced the letter from the 4th/10th century onward.

### d. Juz' markers (cüz gülü / جزء گلى)

Larger marginal medallions marking the **30 divisions** of the Qur'an. In Mamluk Qur'ans, inscribed disks with the juz' number. In Ottoman manuscripts, gold illuminated marginal devices with white text. Appears approximately every 20 pages.

### e. Ḥizb markers (hizb gülü / حزب گلى)

Marginal medallions marking the **60 ḥizb divisions** (each juz' = 2 ḥizb). Similar to juz' markers but differentiated in design. Approximately every 5 pages in Ottoman practice.

### f. Sajda markers (secde gülü / سجده گلى)

Marginal medallions at the **14 prostration verses**. The word "sajda" or "secde" typically appears in white within a gold illuminated medallion. In the Walters Art Museum's Maghribi Qur'an (W.568), an illuminated medallion in gold, blue, and red appears in the right margin.

### g. Surah headbands (sûre başı tezhibi / سوره باشى تذهيبى)

**Terminology:** Ottoman: **sûre başı**, **ser-sûre**, also **ara başlık** for non-Qur'anic section headings. Arabic: **ʿunwān al-sūra** (عنوان السورة).

Illuminated rectangular panels separating surahs, containing the surah name, revelation place, verse count, and number. Mamluk convention: white Kufic on gold ground. Ottoman: white thuluth on gold and polychrome panels. Safavid: gold thuluth reserved against cobalt blue with gold vine scrolls. Maghribi: broken cursive in gold ink. An associated marginal element, **sûre başı gülü**, is a medallion protruding from the heading panel into the margin — large and intricate in early mushafs, disappearing after the 14th century.

---

## 3. Finispiece and colophon decoration: how manuscripts end

**Terminology:** Ottoman: **hâtime** (خاتمه, "ending/conclusion"), **ketebe** (كتبه, "he wrote it"), **ferağ kaydı** (colophon record). Arabic: **khātima** (خاتمة). The hatime page is sometimes called the "ketebe page."

**Visual identification:** The colophon text typically appears in a **triangular/inverted triangular shape** (progressively shorter lines tapering to a point) at the bottom of the final text page. A decorated frame separates the colophon from preceding text. In Ottoman practice, the scribe often switched from *naskh* to **dīwānī** script for the colophon — a distinctive convention. The hatime records the scribe's name, date, location, and patron. Illuminator signatures are rare.

**How finispieces differ from ʿunwān pages:** The ʿunwān features an elaborate headpiece ABOVE beginning text. The finispiece shows text **narrowing to a point**, with decoration framing concluding information rather than announcing a textual beginning. Both maintain consistent decorative programs.

**Tradition-specific features:**

- **Ottoman:** Classical mushaf illumination includes the hatime as one of three key illuminated areas (zahriye, serlevha, hatime). Thicker paper supports heavy gold application.
- **Safavid:** Illuminated ʿunwān panels appear within closing sections, mirroring the opening. The Freer Gallery's Safavid Qur'an (F1932.69) shows white muhaqqaq set in gold and lapis borders.
- **Maghribi:** Sultan Zaydān's Qur'an (1599) features a full-page colophon in gold naskh intertwined with spiraling gold vine on brilliant blue ground, closed by two grand ornamental finispiece pages.
- **Mamluk/Ilkhanid:** Full-page illumination at end of volume balances the frontispiece. The Baybars Qur'an has matching closing pages for each volume.

**Special features:** Some Qur'ans include **letter-counting tables** at the end certifying textual completeness (e.g., Ibn al-Bawwāb Qur'an, Baghdad, 1000–01). Ottoman manuscripts may include *hatim duası* (completion prayer) pages.

---

## 4. Tughra illumination: the sultan's monogram as manuscript art

**Terminology:** Ottoman: **tuğra/tuğrâ** (طغرا). Arabic: **ṭughrā** (طغراء). Persian: **tughrā** (طغرا).

**The five anatomical components:**

- **Sere/Kürsü** (سره): The solid bottom foundation containing the sultan's name, patronymic, and *al-muẓaffar dāʾiman* ("ever victorious"). Evolved from straight lines to triangular forms.
- **Beyze** (بيضه, "egg"): Two large oval loops swelling leftward — the *küçük beyze* (inner/small) and *büyük beyze* (outer/large), popularly interpreted as symbolizing the Black Sea and Mediterranean.
- **Tuğ** (طوغ): Three tall vertical strokes referencing the horse-tail banner signifying independence in Turkic tradition.
- **Zülfe** (ذلفه): S-shaped sinuous lines crossing the tuğlar, symbolizing winds blowing east to west — the direction of Ottoman expansion.
- **Kol/Hançer** (قول/خنجر): The dagger-like horizontal extension tapering rightward, counterbalancing the beyze.

**Illumination in manuscripts vs. firmans:** On firmans, illuminated tughras reach peak elaboration. Suleiman the Magnificent's famous tughra (ca. 1555–60, Metropolitan Museum) shows the Kara Memi style: **saz-style dagger leaves**, double *tahrir* hatayis, carnations, cloud motifs, and penç motifs fill all spaces in gold and lapis blue. In manuscripts, tughras appear at dedications or donation inscriptions. The primary palette is **gold and lapis lazuli** with secondary red, green, and white. Zer-ender-zer (needle burnishing) creates tonal variation within gold fields.

**Historical arc:** First tughra by Sultan Orhan I (r. 1326–62). Classical form under Suleiman. Perfected aesthetically by **Mustafa Râkım Efendi** (1757–1826). Drawn by the court *nişancı* (chancellor). The tughra form is fundamentally Ottoman-Turkic; Safavid and Qajar rulers adopted calligraphic insignia, and Mughal emperors used circular tughras, but the classic five-component form is Ottoman.

---

## 5. Hilye-i şerîf: the calligraphic portrait without an image

**Terminology:** Ottoman: **hilye-i şerîf** (حلیه شریف, "noble description"), **hilye-i saâdet** (حلیه سعادت, "description of felicity"), **hilye-i nebevî** (حلیه نبوی). Arabic: **ḥilya** (حِلْية, "ornament/description").

**The structural elements are named after body parts**, making explicit that the hilye is a non-figural "portrait" of the Prophet Muhammad:

- **Baş makam** (باش مقام, "head station"): Upper rectangular panel with the Basmala in *muhaqqaq* script.
- **Göbek** (گوبك, "navel"): Central roundel containing the physical description of the Prophet attributed to ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib, in *naskh* script.
- **Hilâl** (هلال, "crescent"): Crescent-shaped space around/below the göbek.
- **Köşe yazıları** (corner texts): Four circular medallions in the spandrels containing the names of the four Rashidun caliphs.
- **Kuşak** (قوشاق, "belt"): Horizontal panel below center, typically containing Q 21:107 ("We have not sent you except as a mercy to the worlds").
- **Etek** (اتك, "skirt"): Bottom rectangular panel continuing the hilye text, with the calligrapher's ketebe and date.

**Standardization:** The canonical layout was created by **Hâfız Osman** (1642–1698), the great Ottoman calligrapher. Before him, hilye texts existed in literary form (notably Hakânî Mehmed Bey's verse *Hilye-i Hakânî*), but the calligraphic panel format was Hâfız Osman's innovation. Scripts used: *celî sülüs* for larger sections, *naskh/nesih* for the descriptive text. Some hilyes were mounted on wooden panels as triptychs with folding wings, possibly inspired by Byzantine icon traditions. Crown-shaped tops featured miniatures of Medina or the Ka'ba. Hilyes were believed to have **talismanic properties** and were hung in homes for protection.

## 6. Lacquer painting on paper within manuscripts

**Terminology:** Persian: *roghanī* (روغنی, "lacquered"), *naqāshī-yi roghanī* (لاکی نقاشی, "lacquer painting"). The lacquer material: *roghan-i kamān* or *lāk* (لاک), from shellac resin — distinct from East Asian tree-resin lacquer.

**Technique (confirmed by scientific analysis):** The layer structure consists of pasteboard support → fine white paper → first brownish shellac layer → watercolor/opaque pigments → final transparent shellac varnish. The paint is "sandwiched" between two shellac layers, creating a **glossy, luminous appearance** with deeply saturated colors.

**How to distinguish from regular miniature painting:** Visible surface sheen/gloss; slight amber yellowing from shellac aging; network cracking pattern (distinct from paint flaking); often on pasteboard substrate. Regular miniatures use matte gouache on sized paper without lacquer overlay.

**Traditions:** Safavid (16th–18th c.) — lacquer painting originated in the late 15th century at the Timurid court of Sultan Husayn Bayqara in Herat, primarily on bindings and penboxes. **Qajar** (1789–1925) — the peak era, expanding to penboxes, mirror cases, caskets, and playing cards with markedly European-influenced portraiture and flower paintings. Famous practitioners include **Mīrzā Bābā** (painter laureate under Fatḥ-ʿAlī Shah). Interior page lacquer application is relatively rare; the technique is more commonly associated with bindings and objects, but lacquered album pages exist.

---

## 7. Qıt'a and levha: calligraphic panels as decorative formats

### Qıt'a (قطعه, "piece/specimen")

A calligraphic specimen panel, typically a single sheet with a few lines demonstrating fine penmanship. **Typical layout:** a large line of thuluth surmounting several lines of naskh (or nasta'liq), sometimes with diagonal lines. Persian qit'as often feature nasta'liq quatrains. Decorated with illuminated panels, gold roundels between verses, gold floral frames, and mounted in **muraqqa' albums** on pages ruled in gold with marbled paper (*ebru*) margins. Usually signed by the calligrapher. Key examples: the album *Qit'at-i Khushkhatt* (Edinburgh, Or. Ms. 373) preserving specimens by Mīr ʿAlī Haravī, Shāh Maḥmūd Nīshāpūrī, and others.

**Note:** The term *qiṭʿa* also means "cut-out" in the context of paper cutting (qat'ī) — context determines meaning.

### Levha (لوحه, "tablet")

Larger calligraphic panels for wall display, pasted onto pasteboard and framed with gold flower motifs, colored borders, and marbled margins. Scripts: *celî sülüs*, *celî talik*. Content: Qur'anic verses, hadiths, names of God, poetry. Peak production in **18th–19th century** Ottoman Empire. Functionally analogous to Western framed artwork. The key distinction: **levha = wall display; qıt'a = album mounting**.

---

## 8. Shamsa/medallion pages as interior frontispieces

**Terminology:** Arabic: **shamsa** (شمسة, "little sun"). Persian: **shamseh**; also **toranj** (ترنج, "citron/medallion," sometimes distinguished from round shamsa). Ottoman: **şemse** (شمسه).

**Visual identification:** A **large central medallion or rosette** dominating a full page, radiating outward like a sunburst. Forms include 8-pointed star, 12-pointed star, circular rosette, or lobed/scalloped medallion. The central panel contains an inscription — owner's name, dedication, title, or pious invocation. Surrounded by arabesques, florals, or vegetal motifs in gold and lapis.

**Distinct from binding shamsa:** Binding shamsa is stamped/tooled on leather covers. The shamsa page is an **interior illuminated page** painted in pigments and gold, far more elaborate, serving as a dedication or opening page.

**Historical development (per Alain George):** Earliest known examples from Ilkhanid Azerbaijan, c. 1335 (the **Maragha Qur'an**). Evolved from secular book painting via Rashīd al-Dīn's scriptorium. Gradually replaced the geometric carpet page as the standard frontispiece by the Safavid period.

**Tradition variants:**

- **Mughal:** The **Shah Jahan Album shamsa** (Metropolitan Museum, c. 1645) is the most famous — featuring fantastic flowers, cloud bands, insects, and birds in multiple shades of gold with opaque watercolors. Mughal shamsas show **three-dimensionality and warm coloring** that distinguishes them from Persian examples. The shamsa carried political-religious significance: "The Shamsa is a divine light, which God directly transfers to kings."
- **Safavid:** Blue backgrounds with gold and silver; composed of abstract and floral forms. Safavid school designed first, middle, and last pages with shamsa and toranj motifs.
- **Ottoman:** Şemse medallions on zahriye pages with *mekik* patterns, *münhaniler*, and elaborate *tığ*.

## 9. Multi-register sarlavha compositions: anatomy of the headpiece

**Registers** are the horizontal bands or zones stacked vertically to create a unified headpiece. A typical Ottoman serlevha contains these registers from top to bottom:

1. **Tığ zone** (uppermost): Delicate vertical stalks extending upward from the headpiece dome — fine blue or gold lines with tiny floral terminations.
2. **Dome/kubbe zone**: A scalloped semicircular piece surmounting the rectangle, filled with floral-vegetal decoration in gold, blue, pink, white.
3. **Rectangular headpiece panel**: The main ʿunwān band — a horizontal rectangle with a central gold cartouche (Basmala or sura title) flanked by floral accents.
4. **Koltuk zone**: Illuminated side panels flanking the text block at the headpiece line.
5. **Text well**: Bordered area below with Qur'anic text, verse markers, and decorated margins.

The registers create a **hierarchical visual progression** from pure ornament (top) to text (bottom). The dome and tığ elements suggest upward aspiration — an architectural metaphor like a mihrab. Standard Ottoman serlevha: **3–4 main registers**. Elaborate examples may have 5–7 distinct zones. Simple headpieces may have just 2 (rectangular heading + text). In the **Karahisarî Imperial Qur'an**, multiple scripts (muhaqqaq, rayhanî, thuluth, naskh, tawqī') arranged in distinct registers create additional hierarchical structuring.

---

## 10. Interlinear illumination penetrates the text block itself

**Terminology:** Ottoman: **beyit arası tezhibi** (بيت آراسى تذهيبى, "between-couplet illumination"), **satır arası tezhibi** (سطر آراسى تذهيبى, "between-line illumination"), also **beyne's-sütûr** (بین السطور). The TDV İslâm Ansiklopedisi classifies these as **serbest desenler** (free/asymmetric designs) distinct from the symmetrical panel designs of serlevha.

**Visual identification:** Decorative elements occupy the **spaces between written lines** rather than surrounding the text block. Two principal forms exist:

- **Cloudbands (bulut/abr-i band):** Contour bands following the rise and fall of letters, surrounding each line of text. The space between bands is filled with gold, flowers, or crosshatching. Gold cloud-shaped bands trace script contours above and below each line.
- **Floral/geometric interlinear panels:** White floral sprays on blue ground or gilt sprays filling interlinear spaces.

The technique is **most common in Safavid/Persian** Qur'ans — "text within cloud bands in gold" is a hallmark of Safavid production. Also found in Ottoman elite manuscripts and Mughal interlinear Qur'ans (where Persian translations between Arabic text lines receive decorative treatment). Content includes gold cloud bands with polychrome flowers, white floral sprays on blue ground, gilt sprays, and gold with crosshatching.

---

## 11. Calligraphic decoration types as manuscript elements

### Müsenna / muthanná (مثنى, "doubled")

Mirror calligraphy composed of text and its reflection placed symmetrically along a horizontal or vertical axis. Creates perfectly bilateral symmetry, often forming **abstract geometric, zoomorphic, or architectural compositions** from mirrored text. Common subjects: double *wāw*, *hū*, the Basmala, Kalima-i Tawhid, and Names of God. Flourished particularly in **18th–19th century Bektashi/Sufi** contexts — panels of "Allah," "Muhammad," "ʿAlī" in mirror writing hung in dervish lodges. Can be composed in Kufic, naskh, muhaqqaq, thuluth. Written on *āhar* (egg-white treated) paper with soot ink. The definitive study is Esra Akın-Kıvanç, *Muthanna / Mirror Writing in Islamic Calligraphy* (Indiana University Press, 2020).

### İcâzet / ijāza (اجازت, "permission")

Calligraphic diploma certifying mastery. **Structure:** Top register with Basmala in thuluth; middle registers with demonstration text in naskh showing mastery; lower panels with signed approvals (*taṣdīq*) of master calligraphers; and the *silsila* (chain of teachers) sometimes reaching back to the Prophet. Each section may appear on different colored paper. Illuminated with gold, floral designs, and koltuk panels. The script *rik'a* was so associated with ijāzas that it was called *icâzet yazısı* ("ijāza script"). Highly popular display format in 18th–19th century Ottoman Empire.

### Sülüs-nestaliq combinations

Alternating script styles as decorative device — typically large thuluth lines alternating with smaller naskh or nasta'liq lines within a single composition. The contrast in scale and rhythm between scripts creates visual dynamism while demonstrating calligraphic range.

---

## 12. Miniature painting framing conventions differ sharply across traditions

**Timurid (c. 1370–1507):** Stepped frames where the rectangular text frame steps inward/outward to accommodate images. Text lines embedded within the composition. Gold and polychrome rules (gold, blue, red) define boundaries. Compositions respect ruled borders with controlled, rectilinear extensions.

**Safavid (1501–1722):** The signature innovation is the **"broken frame"** — figures, trees, animals, or architecture deliberately extend beyond the ruled frame (*jadval*) into the margin, creating tension between ordered geometry and overflowing painterly content. The **Shah Tahmasp Shahnama** (c. 1524–35) demonstrates the full repertoire. Warriors, horses, minarets, and vegetation project beyond borders. Peak convention in late 16th–early 17th century Isfahan school. Margins may receive independent gold-painted landscapes (*hashiya*).

**Mughal (1526–1857):** The most elaborate border system. Concentric bands of color create tiered frames. Specialist **border painters (*naqshānavīs*)** — distinct from the main painter (*musavvir*) — executed margins. Under Jahangir, figural margins appear alongside florals; under Shah Jahan, **standardized flowering-plant borders** (tulips, irises, poppies) create garden effects. The Gulshan Album established a convention: margins around illustrations contain floral/arabesque patterns; margins around calligraphic text contain figural scenes.

**Ottoman:** More restrained frame-breaking than Safavid. Dense gold illumination around miniatures. Framing uses the same colored rulings as text (*cedvel*). Later Ottoman painting (17th–18th c.) shows European influence with oval and architectural frame elements.

---

## 13. Catchwords occasionally receive decorative treatment

**Terminology:** The terms **rakabe** (ركابه) and **raqm** (رقم) are not well-attested as standard catchword terminology in major English-language references. The most common cataloging term is simply "catchword." Located at the **bottom left of the verso** of each folio, outside the ruled border.

**When catchwords become decorative:** In luxury court manuscripts, catchwords may be written in **colored ink** (red catchwords appear in some Peshawar Qur'ans and other manuscripts), in **slanting/diagonal writing** (semi-decorative functional choice), in a **different script** from main text (e.g., nastaʿlīq catchwords in a naskh Qur'an), or enclosed within decorative elements. The transition from functional to decorative occurs in high-end production where every page element receives aesthetic treatment. More common in poetry manuscripts than Qur'ans.

---

## 14. Decorated text dividers in non-Qur'anic manuscripts

**Terminology:** Ottoman: **fasıl başı** (فصل باشى, chapter heading), **bahir başı** (بحر باشى), **ara başlık** (آره باشلیق, "intermediate heading"). Arabic: **fāṣil** (فاصل, "separator").

Text dividers in non-Qur'anic manuscripts follow the **logical structure of the text** rather than fixed intervals. Forms include: illuminated panels similar to surah headings adapted for literary works (in Ottoman divans, each poetic form receives a unique heading); **red circles enclosing dots** as text-stops in medical/scientific manuscripts; gold bars or panels separating major divisions; intercolumnar gold rules in poetry; and **koltuk tezhibi** (triangular illuminated side panels) in poetry manuscripts. In Ottoman divans like the Muhibbi Divanı (illuminated by Karamemi), each section heading received unique decorative motifs.

---

## 15. Marginal annotations framed as decorative elements

**Terminology:** Arabic: **ḥāshiya** (حاشيه, marginal gloss). Ottoman: **derkenar** (درکنار, "margin note").

**Decorative treatments include:**

- **Cloud reserves (abr / bulut):** Marginal commentaries written within cloud-shaped reserves on a gold ground — a distinctly **Persian/Safavid** technique creating visual hierarchy between marginal and main text.
- **Border rules and frames:** Marginal text may receive its own simpler ruling system within the wider margins deliberately left for commentary.
- **Color differentiation:** Main text in black; commentary in red or different colored ink; different scripts (e.g., nastaʿlīq commentary on naskh text).
- **Vignettes:** Forms protruding into margins connected to main illumination, enclosing geometric or vegetal designs (per Kislak Center definition).
- **Mughal tradition:** Gilt margins with naturalistic floral borders alongside commentaries.

---

## 16. Cut paper work (qat'ī) simulates calligraphy through cutting

**Terminology:** Arabic/Persian/Ottoman: **qaṭʿī** (قطعی), from *qaṭʿ* (قطع, "cutting"). Practitioners: *qāṭiʿān* (قاطعان, "cutters"). French: *découpage*.

**Technique:** Individual letters, dots, and syllables are cut from paper with fine blades and pasted onto contrasting backgrounds. Light-toned cut-outs on dark grounds (or reverse). The finest examples simulate written calligraphy so precisely that **the collage process is virtually undetectable** without close inspection.

**Origins and practitioners:** Developed at the **Timurid court workshop at Herat** in the late 15th century. The *Dīvān* of Sultan Ḥusayn Bāyqarā (ca. 1490s), calligraphed by Sultan ʿAlī al-Mashhadī, represents the starting point. Key masters include **Sangī ʿAlī Badakhshī**, **Mawlānā Naẕr ʿAlī Qaṭʿī** (who could cut qiṭʿa imitating Mīr ʿAlī's script indistinguishably), **Shaykh ʿAbdallāh Haravī**, and **Dūst-Muḥammad**. Flourished under Safavid patronage in Herat, Bukhara, and Isfahan. Ottoman calligraphers extended the tradition, sometimes creating cutouts shaped like **mosque niches (*mihrab*)** with mirror inscriptions.

**Identification:** Look for slight variations in paper tone/thickness between letters and background; seams at letter edges; contrasting colors; combination with müsennā and architectural framing.

---

## 17. Medallion pendants (tire/tîre): the hanging extensions

**Terminology:** Ottoman: **tire/tîre** (تیره, "pendant"). Also **salbek** (سالبك) specifically for binding pendant forms.

**Visual identification:** Small teardrop, flame-shaped, or lancet-shaped extensions projecting vertically from marginal medallions. They create an **elongated axis**, giving the medallion directionality. Typically 1/3 to 1/2 the height of the parent medallion. Filled with the same decorative program at reduced scale, or as outline/filigree forms.

**Distinction from salbek:** The terms overlap but have distinct primary applications. **Salbek** is specifically associated with binding decoration (pendants from the central şemse on covers). **Tire/tîre** is used more broadly for pendant extensions in **marginal illumination** — projections from marginal gül markers in text pages. Ottoman salbek transitioned from round to largely oval after the 16th century.

**Subtypes:** Simple flame/teardrop; lobed pendant (scalloped edges echoing parent medallion); palmette pendant (half/full palmette form); multi-tiered (nested pendants); axial vs. diagonal projections.

---

## 18. Penwork (kalem işi) is the budget alternative to illumination

**Terminology:** Ottoman: **kalem işi** (قلم ایشی, "pen work"), **kalem tezyīnātı**. Arabic: **taḥrīr** (تحریر, "delineation by pen").

**Visual identification:** Decorative embellishments executed solely with pen and ink — **no gold leaf, no opaque pigments**, no lapis lazuli grounds. Typically 1–3 ink colors (red most common, then blue, occasionally black/green). Simple geometric borders, pen-drawn florets and vine scrolls, marginal dividers, headpiece suggestions with ink arabesques. Distinguished from tezhip by flat, single-layer execution; quick and affordable.

**Most developed in the Maghribi tradition:** North African Qur'ans characteristically use polychrome ink for text and decoration — brown ink for text, diacritics in blue and yellow, voweling in mauve/purple, verse separators as gold and polychrome florets, surah headings in gold Kufic. The decoration is essentially pen-drawn rather than painted. Also common in provincial Ottoman manuscripts, less luxurious Mamluk copies, and sub-imperial Mughal/Indian manuscripts.

---

## 19. Sprinkled decoration (nesr / zerefşân) on text surfaces

**Terminology:** Ottoman: **zerefşân** (زرافشان, "gold-scattering"). Persian: **zarafshān**. Arabic: **nathr al-dhahab** (نثر الذهب, "scattering of gold"). The term **nesr/nathr** (نثر) literally means "scattering."

**Relationship:** *Zerefşān* appears to be the standard term for prepared gold-flecked paper. *Nesr/nathr* may refer more specifically to the act of scattering particles as a **finishing step on completed text pages**, potentially including multicolored particles.

**Technique (Chinese origin):** Gold leaf is ground to fine powder and scattered across the page through a sieve. Binding medium (gum arabic) adheres the particles. Creates tiny irregular gold flecks that catch light at different angles, producing a **shimmering, luminous effect**. Density ranges from fine scattered dust to near-continuous gold ground. Applied to margins only (creating a golden halo around the text block) or across entire pages including over text.

---

## 20. Seal impressions as accumulated decorative layers

**Terminology:** Ottoman: **mühür** (مهر), **vakıf mühürü** (waqf seal), **temellük mühürü** (ownership seal). Arabic: **khatm/khātam** (ختم/خاتم). Persian: **muhr** (مهر).

Over centuries of ownership changes, seals accumulate on **flyleaves, title pages, opening pages, and colophon folios**, creating visual layers. Some manuscripts show **deliberate decorative arrangement** — seals placed symmetrically, marginal roundels designed to frame impressions, hierarchical groupings. The Ottoman **waqf seal tradition** represents the most systematic applied seal practice, with standard formula *waqf li-Llāh taʿālā* ("endowed for God"). Earliest waqf seals date to the early 8th/14th century. Seals themselves are calligraphic art: Kufic (earliest, with leafy terminals), naskh/cursive (14th–15th c.), nastaʿlīq (15th c. Iran, preferred in Indo-Persian world), and Qajar state emblems (lion with rising sun, figural elements). Key reference: Günay Kut and Nimet Bayraktar, *Yazma Eserlerde Vakıf Mühürleri* (1984; expanded 2021).

## 21. Dendân-ı mûşî and the architectural borders of illumination

**Terminology:** Persian/Ottoman: **dendan** (دندان, "tooth"), **dendanlı** (toothed). The compound **dendân-ı mûşî** (دندان موشی, "mouse teeth") designates the finest variant.

**Visual identification:** A continuous symmetrical zigzag or sawtooth edge pattern — **a fine serrated border element** used to define the boundary between illuminated fields and plain paper. Typically executed in **burnished gold**. The TDV İslâm Ansiklopedisi confirms: texts are "mostly bounded by dendan." In 16th-century classical Ottoman illumination, dendans were mandatory. The dendan sits between the cedvel (ruling frame) and the illuminated field. Outside the dendan: *kuzu* (fine parallel line), then *tığ* (ornamental finials projecting outward). On imperial fermans and berats, the hatt-ı hümâyûn section was "encircled with gold dendans."

## 22. Münâvebe: systematic alternation of color fields

**Terminology:** Ottoman/Arabic: **münâvebe** (مناوبه, "alternation," from Arabic *nawba* = turn/shift).

In illumination, this refers to the **systematic alternation of ground colors** within decorative panels. Adjacent *pafta* (compartments) alternate between different ground colors — typically **gold and lapis blue (lâcivert)**, or gold and crimson. The technique is achieved through **ayırma** motifs (rūmī or cloud-form dividing elements) and *kapalı form* (closed compositional forms) that partition the design field into separate color zones. This creates visual rhythm and contrast — the color alternation enriches the design by ensuring adjacent fields never share the same ground. This term appears to circulate more in oral workshop tradition than in published terminology guides.

## 23. Tâcü'l-cedvel and the crown element above the frame

**Terminology:** Arabic/Ottoman: **tâcü'l-cedvel** (تاج الجدول, "crown of the frame"). Related: **tepelik** (crown/cap element).

The concept describes a **decorative crown-shaped extension rising above the rectangular text frame**. The well-documented **tepelik** (literally "crest/cap") is the established Ottoman term for an ornamental motif at the apex of compositions. **Tepelik rûmî** is a crown-form rūmī motif at the top of closed forms and at the symmetry axis; **tepelik bulut** is a crown-form cloud motif serving the same function. The TDV İslâm Ansiklopedisi notes: "tepelik motifs can be applied at the tops and bottoms of closed forms as well as to stems joining at the axis of symmetry." The serlevha itself often features a mihrab-like rise above the rectangle. The tâcü'l-cedvel is specifically this crown element at the summit of the cedvel frame. Found across Ottoman, Timurid, and Safavid traditions.

## 24. Hurde-nakş: painting at the limits of brush control

**Terminology:** Ottoman: **hurde nakış** (خرده نقش), **hurde tezyinat**. "Hurde" (خرده) is Persian for "small, minute, tiny." This was the original Ottoman term for miniature painting before the Western-derived "minyatür" came into use (per Pakalın's *Osmanlı Tarih Deyimleri Sözlüğü*).

**Visual identification:** Decorations so small they approach the limit of what a brush can execute, requiring magnification to fully appreciate. Key form: **hurde rûmî** — rūmī motifs nested inside larger rūmī forms ("rūmī within rūmī"), creating extraordinary density. **Hurde bulut** — miniature cloud motifs used as fill elements. Distinguished from regular illumination by the **exceptional fineness and density** of painted elements. Look for motifs within motifs, secondary and tertiary forms filling the interiors of primary motifs.

**Traditions:** Ottoman classical period (16th c., under masters like Karamemi) and Safavid/Persian tradition. The TDV article notes "hurde" as a motif qualification from Seljuk through Ottoman periods.

## 25. Additional decoration types and elements beyond the standard lists

### Motif-level elements

**Penç** (پنج, "five-petaled flower"): A stylized bird's-eye/plan view of a fully opened flower. The viewer looks directly down at the flower. Central hub (*kaneviçe*) with radiating petals. Petal-count variants: *yekberk* (1), *düberk* (2), *seberk* (3), *ciharberk* (4), *pençberk* (5, most common), *şeşberk* (6), *sadberk* (many). **Çarkıfelek**: when petals curve in one direction, creating a pinwheel. The penç is the plan-view complement to hatāyī's elevation/profile view.

**Goncagül** (غنچه‌گل, "rosebud"): A profile view of an unopened or partially opened bud, showing the calyx (*çanak*) embracing petals. Directional motif. Represents the immature stage; hatāyī represents the fully opened flower.

**Yaprak** (یپراق, "leaf"): Stylized leaf forms serving as independent elements and building blocks. In saz compositions, leaves become large with serrated edges — *hançer yaprak* (dagger leaf). Gained prominence in the 16th century under Karamemi's naturalistic style.

### Compositional and structural elements

**Ortabağ / agraf / düğüm / kenet** (junction ornaments): Small binding motifs at stem intersections. "Neither touching stems nor stem divisions are left bare; at these points, tepelik, knot, agraf are placed." Also *ortabağ bulut* — linking cloud elements between cloud forms.

**Ayırma** (dividing motifs): Rūmī or cloud motifs used to divide compositional fields into separate color zones, creating the münâvebe (alternation) effect. **Ayırma rûmî** and **ayırma bulut** are the two main types.

**Sıvama altın** (سیواما آلتین, "solid gold ground"): Entire background surface covered with solid gold leaf, burnished, then design painted on top. Distinguished from classical tezhip where individual motifs are gilded. Characteristic of later Ottoman work (18th–19th c.) and earlier Timurid luxury manuscripts. The TDV notes: "In 19th-century serlevha illuminations, solid gold and needle burnishing were used extensively."

**Çift tahrir / havalı** ("double outline/airy"): Motif details drawn with two parallel outline strokes with bare ground between them. Called "havalı" because of the space/air between the lines. On dark grounds, light outlines; on light grounds, dark. Has sub-techniques: *sıvama* (solid fill) and *taramalı* (hatched). Requires exceptional brush control. Used in koltuk illuminations and tığ work.

**İplik / kuzu** (thread and lamb lines): Fine decorative lines for framing, separating color fields, and enriching the border system. *İplik* = thin thread-line parallel to cedvel; *kuzu* = very fine line parallel to the main border. "The kuzu drawn parallel to the iplik and the tığ ensure the design blends with the outer ground."

**Kapalı form** ("closed form"): Enclosed compositional spaces created by interlocking stems, allowing different ground colors in each compartment — the structural mechanism enabling münâvebe.

**Ulama desen** (repeat/rapport pattern): Infinitely tileable designs used in zahriye, koltuk, and cover decoration.

### Period-specific decoration types

**Şükûfe** (شکوفه, "blossom"): Semi-naturalistic to realistic flower paintings emerging in the 18th century under European influence. Distinguished from classical motifs by realistic rendering, use of shading rather than flat color, and botanical accuracy. **Karamemi** laid foundations in the 16th century; full şükûfe style developed in the **Lâle Devri (Tulip Era, 1718–1730)**. Distinctively Ottoman.

**Çintemani** (three-dot and tiger-stripe pattern): Three dots in a triangle combined with two wavy parallel lines. Derives from Central Asian Buddhist symbolism, became an Ottoman sovereignty symbol. Appears sparingly in tezhip compared to textiles and ceramics.

**Lâcivert** (لاجورد): Not merely a color but a **characteristic decorative ground** — deep lapis lazuli blue serves as the fundamental partner to gold in classical tezhip. The TDV consistently notes "cobalt blue comes to the fore as the most commonly used background color after gold."

## Conclusion: a living vocabulary still partly oral

This survey reveals that Islamic manuscript decoration encompasses a far more granular vocabulary than standard surveys convey. Several findings stand out. First, many terms — *münâvebe*, *dendân-ı mûşî*, *tâcü'l-cedvel* — circulate primarily in **oral workshop tradition** rather than published glossaries, making them difficult to document from textual sources alone. Second, the Ottoman TDV İslâm Ansiklopedisi (particularly the entries by İnci Ayan Birol, Gülnur Duran, and F.Ç. Derman) provides the most systematically codified terminology, while the Kislak Center at Penn acknowledges that "the vocabulary for describing Islamic manuscript illumination is not standardized." Third, some categories — like the **mushaf gülleri** hierarchy (durak, hamse, aşere, hizb, cüz, secde, sûre başı) — constitute entire sub-systems with their own internal logic and historical evolution. Fourth, the motif-level vocabulary (*penç*, *goncagül*, *yaprak*, *ortabağ*, *ayırma*, *tepelik*) represents a compositional grammar that underlies all higher-level decoration types but is rarely treated as a decoration "type" in its own right. Finally, techniques like *çift tahrir*, *sıvama altın*, *hurde-nakş*, and *kalem işi* describe not what appears but **how it was made** — a parallel terminology of process that intersects with but does not map neatly onto the taxonomy of visual forms.
